So far, I have ""All the Love in the World"" and ""The Day the World Went Away"" (NIN), ""Isn't Everyone"" (HEALTH), ""Spiders"" (System of a Down)...",Metal,ifyoulikeblank,2,medium,https://reddit.com/r/ifyoulikeblank/comments/1oj4xc0/iil_sullen_industrial_music/,reddit,,,,,,

Tool,"Having a listen to all of these, you've definitely got a type! Slow building, somewhat gothic, atmospheric and emotionally charged. So...

Tool - Wings For Marie / 10,000 Days (back to back is the only way to listen to these)

As with many of Maynard's songs, this tackles his mother's unwavering piousness in the face of her disability, and his cynicism towards it. It's climax is unrelenting. I was also tempted to recommend The Noose by A Perfect Circle (another of his bands) which deals with similar themes.

Porcupine Tree - Anesthetize

Slow building and dark, this song captures individual loneliness and mental struggle in the midst of a fractured, cathode-drowned society. If you like it, I'd recommend Russia on Ice for it's slow build, or shesmoviedon for it's perfect solo.

Manchester Orchestra - The Silence

Slow building and powerful - an introspective look at escaping the shackles of genetic inheritance. Andy Hull's vocals are, a bit like Jeff's, mesmerising and overwhelming in their beauty. Other songs I'd recommend are Rear View and Dinosaur.

Josh Ritter - Dreams

Bit more folky than the rest, this one looks at depression. His lyrical prowess is on display here - the imagery is incredible. He hasn't really done any others like it.

The Decemberists - The Island...

One of those breaking the mould prog tracks from a classically folk outfit - this is a retelling of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Joan in the Garden is their other similar track.

Typhoon - Ariadne

The closer on a brilliant album about spiralling dementia - dark, brooding and wonderfully orchestral. If you like it... the whole album is a journey to it I'd recommend taking. And their other albums (although less brooding). I could wax lyrical all day tbh.

,"IIL Only in Dreams by Weezer, Forget Her by Jeff Buckley, Limousine by Brand New, what else would i like? | Okay so here are some songs and *why* i like them, hopefully this helps.



Only in Dreams by Weezer : i love the slow buildup with the bassline.. To a perfect solo. The lyrics are also super fucking touching.



Forget Her by Jeff Buckley : His voice is one of the best i have ever heard, the raw emotion is incredible, the lyrics are extremely relatable.



Limousine by Brand New : i love when bands move away from their respective subgenres to create longer pieces of music that take you on a jou",Anesthetize Slow building and dark,Porcupine Tree,"Having a listen to all of these, you've definitely got a type! Slow building, somewhat gothic, atmospheric and emotionally charged. So...

Tool - Wings For Marie / 10,000 Days (back to back is the only way to listen to these)

As with many of Maynard's songs, this tackles his mother's unwavering piousness in the face of her disability, and his cynicism towards it. It's climax is unrelenting. I was also tempted to recommend The Noose by A Perfect Circle (another of his bands) which deals with similar themes.

Porcupine Tree - Anesthetize

Slow building and dark, this song captures individual loneliness and mental struggle in the midst of a fractured, cathode-drowned society. If you like it, I'd recommend Russia on Ice for it's slow build, or shesmoviedon for it's perfect solo.

Manchester Orchestra - The Silence

Slow building and powerful - an introspective look at escaping the shackles of genetic inheritance. Andy Hull's vocals are, a bit like Jeff's, mesmerising and overwhelming in their beauty. Other songs I'd recommend are Rear View and Dinosaur.

Josh Ritter - Dreams

Bit more folky than the rest, this one looks at depression. His lyrical prowess is on display here - the imagery is incredible. He hasn't really done any others like it.

The Decemberists - The Island...

One of those breaking the mould prog tracks from a classically folk outfit - this is a retelling of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Joan in the Garden is their other similar track.

Typhoon - Ariadne

The closer on a brilliant album about spiralling dementia - dark, brooding and wonderfully orchestral. If you like it... the whole album is a journey to it I'd recommend taking. And their other albums (although less brooding). I could wax lyrical all day tbh.

Connor really broke from his acoustic folk sound from his earliest album and seems to be doing what he wants beyond the confines of genre.

I might suggest :

Magnolia ( 1999 )
21 Grams ( 2003 )
Both ensemble cast, slice of lives interacting style movies in the style of Crash ( 2004 )

Mysterious Skin ( 2004 ).  Shares an unpleasant theme with Happiness, so consider that a trigger warning.

Leaving Las Vegas (1995 ). Intense romance? Check.  Devastating and depressing? Check. Dark Subject matter? Oh, dear, there's a lot of that. A very unflattering portrait of addiction. ""Mike Figgis' “Leaving Las Vegas” (1995) is not a love story, although it feels like one, but a story about two desperate people using love as a form of prayer and a last resort against their pain.""

Synechdoche, New York ( 2008 ). ""Charlie Kaufman’s directorial debut is either a masterpiece or a massively dysfunctional act of self-indulgence"".  Sounds right up your street :-)


Saint Maud ( 2019 ). Advertised as horror but more pychologically creepy. Weird and ominous and dark.  Good times!


Anything directed by Gaspar Noé would probably be a good suggestion for you but I'll go with Climax ( 2018 ) which I found mesmerising and disturbing. Other mentions by him would be Irreversible ( 2002,  the best movie I will never watch again, serious trigger warnings for that one, eeek )  or Enter The Void ( 2009, a really hard watch due to subject matter and technique but it's unique and horrifying and something that I will always remember).

My suggestion request might be kind of specific, but I'm making a playlist with several songs that I think fit this criteria.

She’s perfectly lovely in interviews and seems a good role model for girls.
She is likeable and seems to carry her success well. 

I’m just trying to understand how she could’ve reached such astronomical heights of success when her music is comparatively so … bland?

While her contemporaries excel at all the things you mentioned, Swift has succeeded in mediocrity. She is simply the best at being bland. And that has wide range appeal. 

From what I can tell, the themes she writes songs about that people resonate with are the most common denominator themes for people whose height of identity and social interaction was in high school. She has essentially created an image that tells her fans “See? You too can become wildly successful and famous without having to be particularly interesting or talented in any way!” I think this creates a sense of both comfort and possibility in her fans. 

Simply put, the majority of people are relatively unremarkable, and Swift has cornered the market in being unremarkable. I think from this last album we can tell that it’s a numbers game. Her defenders say “the album charted” but that doesn’t mean it’s good; when consumption is easily digestible for the masses and the masses have poor taste that is going to equate to massive popularity.",,LetsTalkMusic,8,medium,,,proximity,s not about the music Not a Taylor hate post,I’m asking sincerely and in good faith She’s perfectly lovely in interviews and s,ft phenomenon Does anyone else feel,,

Another one that came to mind for me was “Satisfaction”",Sung Tongs - all their albums vary wildly in sound,Animal Collective,"Lots of good examples ITT, and here are a couple of others worth adding too

Animal Collective - Sung Tongs - all their albums vary wildly in sound, but the core of what makes Animal Collective Animal Collective really gets laid down here - the harmonies, the noisy and busy production, and calling on 60s/70s pop melodies gets put together here fully, whereas prior releases only dabbled in one or two aspects of what would become their sound.

King Gheedorah - Take Me to Your Leader - the first ""MF DOOM"" (if you can call it that) that to me really feels like a DOOM album, even if he only raps on two songs on it. However, this is where his production really comes into its own, and the sound collages and the sources he samples from here are the beginnings of quintessential DOOM. KMD sounded completely different, and Operation Doomsday, although solid, is only the beginning of him fleshing out his post-KMD sound, you can see the ideas that defined DOOM but I'd argue it doesnt get realized til this release.

Earl Sweatshirt - Some Rap Songs - all his releases up til this album have been getting closer to hinting in the direction this album would take, but after this came out, Earl has firmly settled in his niche and owns it. Plus, it seems like every release he's made after is treading the same ground Some Rap Songs established.",,LetsTalkMusic,6,medium,,,proximity,certain artists where,songs,but I feel | s Cobain finally not feel,"a DOOM album, even if he only raps on two songs on it | However, this is where his production really comes into its own, and the sound collages and the sources he samples from here are the beginnings of quintessential DOOM",
,"Does anyone get strange/fraudulent vibes from Chris Martin? (An honest convo) | I have been following not so much Coldplay as I have been following Chris Martin for a while. I find him to be one of the most interesting, complex, difficult-to-pin down human beings on planet earth, and I am saying that from the perspective of a non-superfan who does love a handful of Coldplay songs (Square One! Don't Panic! Arabesque! A L I E N S!) but otherwise gets icked out by a lot of their music and by the man who sings it. The rest of the band seem to be relatively normal people despite",Sting,England who embraced fame in America,""" the most bizarre pop culture figure of all time"" is a bold claim in a world that has included the likes of Michael Jackson or Yoko Ono, to name just two.

I think we can overthink things here. As I see it, Chris Martin was just a rather posh but ordinary, middle class student, somewhat introvert, reflective and awkward, who listened to Radiohead and Travis and U2 and wrote some songs - and then through luck and timing and a bit of a knack for trend-following, has found himself being a world famous star. So he tries to act like one, but I think in himself is really a bit stuck as that insecure student. 

There are parallels, I think, with other very middle class students from England who embraced fame in America - Sting, maybe. Or even David Gilmore. 

I think i'd be the same in his situation - yeah, I'd take up the chance to embrace the money and the lifestyle, but I'm just a quiet, geeky, unassuming Brit - I'd feel out of place and awkward with the fame, and I'd just try and act my way through it, playing the part, as part of my job.",,LetsTalkMusic,29,medium,,,proximity,,,he just feels fraudulent to his very core these days Whatever | the entire public But he just feel,"I think i'd be the same in his situation - yeah, I'd take up the chance to embrace the money and the lifestyle, but I'm just a quiet, geeky, unassuming Brit - I'd feel out of place and awkward with the fame, and I'd just try and act my way through it, playing the part, as part of my job.",

The rest of the band seem to be relatively normal people despite",I'd feel out of place and awkward with the fame,Brit,""" the most bizarre pop culture figure of all time"" is a bold claim in a world that has included the likes of Michael Jackson or Yoko Ono, to name just two.

I think we can overthink things here. As I see it, Chris Martin was just a rather posh but ordinary, middle class student, somewhat introvert, reflective and awkward, who listened to Radiohead and Travis and U2 and wrote some songs - and then through luck and timing and a bit of a knack for trend-following, has found himself being a world famous star. So he tries to act like one, but I think in himself is really a bit stuck as that insecure student. 

There are parallels, I think, with other very middle class students from England who embraced fame in America - Sting, maybe. Or even David Gilmore. 

I think i'd be the same in his situation - yeah, I'd take up the chance to embrace the money and the lifestyle, but I'm just a quiet, geeky, unassuming Brit - I'd feel out of place and awkward with the fame, and I'd just try and act my way through it, playing the part, as part of my job.",,LetsTalkMusic,29,medium,,,proximity,,,he just feels fraudulent to his very core these days Whatever | the entire public But he just feel,"I think i'd be the same in his situation - yeah, I'd take up the chance to embrace the money and the lifestyle, but I'm just a quiet, geeky, unassuming Brit - I'd feel out of place and awkward with the fame, and I'd just try and act my way through it, playing the part, as part of my job.",

Hardcore Coldplay fan here, especially of Chris, so I thought I'd put  in my 2 cents. I'll just recommend 2 things if you really want to understand better how Chris ""works"" and how he became who he is:

* Pete Holmes' podcast ""You Made It Weird"" with Chris as a guest, September 2021. Chris talks in great lengths about what fuels/fuelled him to become who he is, and his relationship with fame.
* The A Head Full of Dreams documentary made by Mat Whitecross in 2018.

These will explain better than me that talent really hasn't got anything to do with fame, first and foremost. If you really get into Coldplay and their philosophy nowadays (since the last 5 albums I'd say), you get to see that despite the whole rock star thing and despite all the weirdness one might see in him, Chris is probably the most down to earth and human person I know of. That is ultimately what I am fascinated about and what helps them ""own"" every stadium they play to.",,LetsTalkMusic,2,medium,,,proximity,,,he just feels fraudulent to his very core these days Whatever | the entire public But he just feel,,

I do a playlist called [Singled Out](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0QGts9ViNDZOU2VGCJzMya?si=GxGb_0ZfR_-t2j5owmkrzQ) of new release singles of the week for the whole year.  I update it every Friday if anyone's interested.  The first **13** tracks are for this week.  Everything after that is previous weeks going back to the first of the year.  


**Highlights This Week: ** Baltimore, Md. Neo-Psych  band **Animal Collective** drop *Buddies On the Blackboard* the B-Side to June's release of *Love On the Big Screen*.


London, UK Alt-R&B musician **Nourished by Time / Marcus Brown** releases the 3rd cut *Baby Baby* from his upcoming LP *The Passionate Ones* due **Aug 22**.  This has been my fav of his new tracks, sick beat on here. Really lookin forward to the whole album.


Nashville, Tn. Egg-Punk crew **Snõõper** just released the manic fun *Unknown Caller EP* at the end of June.  This week they hit us with *Worldwide* the title track for their upcoming sophomore LP due **Oct 3.**  I've had this track on on repeat pretty much since it posted.


Baltimore, Md. Indie-Rock band **Teen Suicide** drop a duo of new tracks *Fade 2 Blue* a fuzzed out ripper & *New Tattoo* a solid Lo-Fi bedroom acoustic cut. Really enjoyed both of these.

Always liked the Flaming Lips ever since my high school days (I was born in 1996). The Soft Bulletin & Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots are wonderful albums for sure, but I want to give a shout out to the Ronald Jones era of the Flaming Lips.

In 1966, Kinks frontman and songwriter Ray Davies was at a creative crossroads. Though the Kinks were always seen in popular culture as the natural competitor to fellow Brits the Beatles, Davies didn’t see himself as McCartney, Lennon, Harrison, or Starr.

In his mind, he was Brian Wilson. And the Kinks were capable of becoming the Beach Boys.

After the release of the Beach Boys’ creat",I genuinely appreciate the thoughtful response!,Again,"What a great response! My hope in posting this was that I'd get thoughtful responses to pressure test my ideas, so thank you for that!

I think my big takeaway is that I think I've overstated the prevalence of the negative aspects of nostalgia I see in the overarching themes of ""Village Green."" While I do still believe he's generally skeptical of nostalgia, based in large part on where he was artistically at the time and constraints he felt himself under while writing ""VG,"" perhaps I'd be more accurate in saying that the album is a meditation on nostalgia in general - both the good and the bad.

That's where I think ""Do You Remember Walter"" and ""Johnny Thunder"" come in. ""Johnny"" is the quintessential tall tale that gets told in small town (having grown up in one myself, I know these well). Meanwhile, I do see some of the themes I discussed cropping up in ""Walter:""

*""And you're always home in bed by half past eight.*  
*And if I talked about the old times, you'd get bored*  
*And you'd have nothing more to say.""*

I think we see two sides of the same coin in this song: On one, the narrator who yearns for the past and to relive old memories, and with Walter we have someone who has moved on. The narrator wants Walter to be someone he isn't anymore - nor does Walter have any interest in being again.

(Let me add here, I promise I didn't omit mentioning either song because it didn't fit my argument. I just didn't thinking listing every song would make for a very compelling read, so I called out what I thought were the most interesting examples.)

Now, on the ""Steam Powered Train,"" I think we disagree a little more distinctly.

*""In terms of how it fits into the album it's saying that Davies as a musician can ""live in a museum.""*

Davies was roughly 22 when this album was written, and he was experiencing a well-documented artistic rut caused by his perceived limitations of the Kinks' sound.

After the release of the Beach Boys’ creat",Lamb Lies Down on Broadway album,Genesis.,"I agree. You can see it as well in songs like Picture Book and People Take Pictures of Each Other. Or Animal Farm. A lot of it is very sincere. 

Later, on their Preservation Act albums you see the same kind of sentiment and disdain for developers and ""tearing down little houses to build tenement buildings."" Like [Demolition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jlwzfPhsKM) where there's a direct callback to Village Green.  

But that theme was in a lot of music at that time, Joni's Big Yellow Taxi, or Steve Miller's Going to the Country off the top of my head.

,"Kendrick Lamar & The Super Bowl: On Being a Longtime, White Guy Fan, an essay -- also, lets talk about the Halftime show! | I'm a die hard fan of Kendrick Lamar and I have been since 2011. His music has grown up with me, and watching him soar to the heights of influence and respect that he's at now has been such a fun ride to witness. I wrote the following essay to explore my admiration for him as an influential artist in my life. When he was announced for the Super Bowl, I knew he'd deliver a stunning show. I think he did...do you? 

If you didn't enjoy the show, why not? Is it because you're largely not into Hip Ho",Gambino,I enjoy,"I guess its not apparent from just what I wrote, but I'd argue I am pretty into the genre as a whole. I don't feel the need to start listing all the people I listen to to ""prove"" that, but there are plenty of artists I enjoy - Gambino, Future, Megan, Yasiin Bey, Tupac, to name a few. Kendrick happens to be my personal favorite because he started making major music right when I was in college, and I've kept up closely ever since. He's my guy ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Eh, I guess lol America nowadays makes me pretty sad overall. I think we're declining and crumbling as a country if I'm being honest. I'm not arguing doing the Super Bowl as being the only and final measure as to Kendrick's, or anyone's, quality, I just think its worth celebrating and thinking about. It's a big deal.
