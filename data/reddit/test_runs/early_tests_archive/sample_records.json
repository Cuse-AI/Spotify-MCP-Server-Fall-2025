Particularly looking for albums. | Specifically what I love so much about these four albums is the way they just *rip* across their tracklists with high speed punk songs that still manage to make incredible ***pop*** songs. The melodies, vocal harmonies, chord progressions, I think the way the songs are written and arranged on these four albums is something special that I've been looking for more of my entire life.

The band was very aware of this being weird and actually included a brief audio snippet of one of them saying no way the song goes on the record right before it starts to play. i get it. its one of the best songs of the decade and it should have gotten Longview level airplay.\n\nAlso, i have a friend who does a podcast where they go through all the fat wreck chords releases. if that's something you'd be into reply and ill drop the link."
