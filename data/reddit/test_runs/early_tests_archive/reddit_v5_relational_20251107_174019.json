    "selftext": "Okay so here are some songs and *why* i like them, hopefully this helps.\n\n\n\nOnly in Dreams by Weezer : i love the slow buildup with the bassline.. To a perfect solo. The lyrics are also super fucking touching.\n\n\n\nForget Her by Jeff Buckley : His voice is one of the best i have ever heard, the raw emotion is incredible, the lyrics are extremely relatable.\n\n\n\nLimousine by Brand New : i love when bands move away from their respective subgenres to create longer pieces of music that take you on a journey. Limousine is long, but it builds up to one of my favorite climaxes ever. Jesse Lacey's vocals are incredible.\n\n  \nThe Same Deep Water As You by The Cure : Robert Smith is master lyricist and a great vocalist, but what i like even more in this song is the atmosphere that's being built. It's hands down by favorite song on disintegration.\n\n\n\nNew Dawn Fades by Joy Division : Ian Curtis' lyrics helped me through some of my darkest times. But when it comes to New Dawn Fades it's every single part of the track that moves me. Every instrument has a thing to say and it feels dry and dead but at the same time extremely emotional, idk how to describe it lol.\n\n  \nBroken Again by Blade and Bath : Been getting into DSBM lately and i love how it's not just the regular trope of low quality potato produced black metal. It's actual people writing about depressing experiences that connect with you and i feel like Broken Again is the perfect representation of that.\n\n  \nyour recommendations don't need to resemble all of these songs at once, i will take anything you guys have that resembles any one of the tracks i mentioned.",

So...\n\nTool - Wings For Marie / 10,000 Days (back to back is the only way to listen to these)\n\nAs with many of Maynard's songs, this tackles his mother's unwavering piousness in the face of her disability, and his cynicism towards it. It's climax is unrelenting. I was also tempted to recommend The Noose by A Perfect Circle (another of his bands) which deals with similar themes.\n\nPorcupine Tree - Anesthetize\n\nSlow building and dark, this song captures individual loneliness and mental struggle in the midst of a fractured, cathode-drowned society. If you like it, I'd recommend Russia on Ice for it's slow build, or shesmoviedon for it's perfect solo.\n\nManchester Orchestra - The Silence\n\nSlow building and powerful - an introspective look at escaping the shackles of genetic inheritance. Andy Hull's vocals are, a bit like Jeff's, mesmerising and overwhelming in their beauty. Other songs I'd recommend are Rear View and Dinosaur.\n\nJosh Ritter - Dreams\n\nBit more folky than the rest, this one looks at depression. His lyrical prowess is on display here - the imagery is incredible. He hasn't really done any others like it.\n\nThe Decemberists - The Island...\n\nOne of those breaking the mould prog tracks from a classically folk outfit - this is a retelling of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Joan in the Garden is their other similar track.\n\nTyphoon - Ariadne\n\nThe closer on a brilliant album about spiralling dementia - dark, brooding and wonderfully orchestral. If you like it... the whole album is a journey to it I'd recommend taking. And their other albums (although less brooding). I could wax lyrical all day tbh.\n\nHope you like these!",

It's more than just enjoyment. So, what else do you think I would like, enjoy or even love? The combination of finger-picking style, just singer + guitar (plus bass), and poetic stories is amazing. Anything else like that? \n\nSome of his other stuff scratch that itch, like \"Story of Isaac\" and \"The Partisan.\" But the rest just doesn't have this raw, poetic, emotional, solitary feeling that I get from the first album. Bob Dylan's \"Simple Twist of Fate\" also comes really close to what I feel with Cohen's album. (I also love Dylan, and *Blood on the Tracks* is up there with *Songs of Leonard Cohen* and *Dark Side of the Moon* as the best pieces of music I have ever listened to. However, for this post I would like to focus on Cohen's album.)\n\nLet me know what you think. I understand that, possibly, nothing can be quite like this album.

When a song gets to the peak moment and all the artists are passing to their best but the one thing that sounds like is meant to be the main focus is struggling to be heard. One example is Run by Joji. At the end of the song there's a guitar solo accompanied by bass and drums and Joji is singing slightly quieter over it but the line \"know your not alone\" specifically is edited in a way that it sounds like its fighting to be heard at all. The desperation from that line leaves me feeling so hollow afterwards. Another different example is the song UGO by the dead pirates. This time at the end every artist is going absolutely manic on their instruments, drums, bass, and backing guitar and the whole time the lead guitar is smashing out a solo that goes back and forth between being the primary layer and being hidden behind the other instruments. \n\nSo I'm looking for more songs with these kinds of moments but I'll also gladly take recommendations for songs that elicit similar emotions of desperation.

While it is folk, some of the instruments and sounds used are different from traditional folk, like some songs having electric guitars and heavy percussion, which makes it hard to find similar sounds within the genre. I haven't been able to find any other artists that hit this niche since it is really unique and most folk artists don't tend to make music with this darker tone, but I really need more of this sound and I was hoping anyone had any suggestions!",

Love the really crispy, percussive samples here.\n\n[I Want You (She's So Heavy) — The Beatles](https://youtu.be/tAe2Q_LhY8g), especially the outro with the hissing that gets more and more intense.\n\n[INVISIBLE — Duran Duran](https://youtu.be/FKwVFWwA_x8).

A crowning achievement of a record that I don't think he'll eclipse.\n\nVillagers is brilliant for pushing boundaries and blending genres - lots of piano, strings and electronic sampling mixed in. Sometimes sounds timeless, sometimes like house music. Connor really broke from his acoustic folk sound from his earliest album and seems to be doing what he wants beyond the confines of genre.\n\nThose are three that spring to mind on the topic of 'textured' music.

Doesn't have to be rap, any genre at all is welcome if it checks enough boxes. \n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "Specifically what I love so much about these four albums is the way they just *rip* across their tracklists with high speed punk songs that still manage to make incredible ***pop*** songs. The melodies, vocal harmonies, chord progressions, I think the way the songs are written and arranged on these four albums is something special that I've been looking for more of my entire life. There's an incredible balance between energetic, fast, sloppy punk arrangements and slick, catchy, simple pop songwriting. You can take any of the songs on these four albums and play them slower and achieve something like the mega hits bands like Weezer, Blur, Oasis, and post-Insomniac Green Day had in the mid-late 90s and early 00s. Songs like Wonderwall or Say It Aint So with those giant hooks and immortal earworm melodies.\n\nAnother thing I particularly love about these albums, besides Insomniac, is that 90% of the songs are love songs. They all sound like they could be punk covers of early Beatles hits. Only of You, The Judge's Daughter, At the Library, 2000 Light-Years Away, etc. Those are my favorites. \n\nThe closest I've come is Husker Du, the Ramones, and the first Clash album.\n\nHusker Du probably come closest I've ever heard, but they have two separate singer-songwriters and if I skimmed their Wiki page right it's the guitarist Grant Hart's songs that achieve what I'm looking for perfectly (which I type while listening to Dont Want to Know If You Are Lonely and remembering how much I love this fuckin song) and the drummer Bob Mould's songs that dont quite do it for me mainly because of his voice, musically I dig them. I also find myself being really disappointed with the recording of his drums. Very flat. I know it's indie punk music from the 80s but I dont have that same trouble with Ramones records from the 70s. (As I finished this paragraph Makes No Sense At All just came up and this is maybe the single closest song to what I'm describing I've ever heard. Forgot how much I loved ",

Some examples of more intense movies I do like include along with  why I like them:\n\n\\-Dear Zachary (My favorite movie, the themes about grief and the intense emotional highs and lows get to me)\n\n\\-Hereditary (Familial grief plus believable portrayal of mental illness)\n\n\\-It's Such a Beautiful Day (The slow mental degradation of the main character)\n\n\\-Lake Mungo (The realistic portrayal of familial grief plus existential dread throughout the movie)\n\n\\-Requiem for a Dream (Watching the characters' slow degradation throughout the story)\n\n\\-Leaving Las Vegas (Themes of alcoholism and watching the main character give up on his dreams)\n\n\\-Come and See (A war movie that managed to get me emotionally invested by putting it through the perspective of a kid)\n\n\\-Grave of the Fireflies (I can't really articulate why I like this movie, but people talk about how depressing it is)\n\n\\-Reign Over Me (Seeing a mentally unwell character struggling to move on from a traumatic experience)\n\n\\-The Whale (Mostly the scenes where the main character is eating himself to death)\n\ntl;dr The kinda movies that I get the most emotionally invested in are usually about grief or have a strong focus on the character's emotional journey. I don't really like movies about people in hopeless situations out of their control (I.E. setting it in a post-apocalyptic world or war movies with the one exception). They also don't need to sad from beginning to end, the best movies can balance the emotional highs with emotional lows to make for an engaging experience.",

Been trying to find anything similar. Something hauntingly beautiful with hints of mellow surf rock undertones that retains some chill but gradually gets more intense without overdoing it.

Very good.\n\nI might suggest :\n\nMagnolia ( 1999 )\n21 Grams ( 2003 )\nBoth ensemble cast, slice of lives interacting style movies in the style of Crash ( 2004 )\n\nMysterious Skin ( 2004 ).  Shares an unpleasant theme with Happiness, so consider that a trigger warning.\n\nLeaving Las Vegas (1995 ). Intense romance? Check.  Devastating and depressing? Check. Dark Subject matter? Oh, dear, there's a lot of that. A very unflattering portrait of addiction. \"Mike Figgis' “Leaving Las Vegas” (1995) is not a love story, although it feels like one, but a story about two desperate people using love as a form of prayer and a last resort against their pain.\"\n\nSynechdoche, New York ( 2008 ). \"Charlie Kaufman’s directorial debut is either a masterpiece or a massively dysfunctional act of self-indulgence\".  Sounds right up your street :-)\n\n\nSaint Maud ( 2019 ). Advertised as horror but more pychologically creepy. Weird and ominous and dark.  Good times!\n\n\nAnything directed by Gaspar Noé would probably be a good suggestion for you but I'll go with Climax ( 2018 ) which I found mesmerising and disturbing. Other mentions by him would be Irreversible ( 2002,  the best movie I will never watch again, serious trigger warnings for that one, eeek )  or Enter The Void ( 2009, a really hard watch due to subject matter and technique but it's unique and horrifying and something that I will always remember).\n\n\n\nI see you like some Park Chan-wook too.

    "title": "Why R.E.M.'s Automatic For The People is my favourite album of all time...",
    "selftext": "This is such an outlier for me. I can't even say I'm *that* big of a fan of R.E.M., yet this album easily sits above anything else I've ever listened to from beginning to end. As a music fan, my tastes are varied. From the Red Hot Chilli Peppers to The Thievery Corporation, from Rare Bird to Alex Somers and Goldfrapp - I've consumed a lot of music in my lifetime. I have my \"big 4\", who sit at the top and are unlikely to ever be displaced; The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Madonna and George Michael. Yet no album by any of these artists will likely move Automatic For The People from my #1 spot. And yes, even as a Brit, I'm including The Beatles in that.\n\nSo why is Automatic For The People my favourite album of all time? Well the answer comes with that final word right there. **Time**. I remember listening to bits of this album as a young boy in early 1993. I honestly dismissed it as nonsensical grown up drivel, as most of us probably did desperately trying to look cool bouncing around a school disco listening to Mr. Blobby. I digress.\n\nFast forward 30 years - I've suffered loss, pain, personal issues and even a homosexual divorce. The sheer drama of it all. I've had good moments too, but this is where this album comes into its own. From the opening twangs of *Drive*, to the unmistakable riffs of *Try Not To Breathe* to the boundless energy of *The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite.* All remarkably great songs.\n\nThen we get to *Everybody Hurts*. To most people, a Kurt Cobain inspired, misery inducing dirge about loss, sadness and trying to avoid the inevitable. To me, an uplifting athem of hope. Because, for as melancholic as the first 4 minutes might be, those final 90 seconds or so are probably the most inspiring 90 seconds I've ever heard in music. The relentless winding up of the organ, the strings section going batshit and Stipe's cries of \"hold on\"... a truly, truly remarkable piece of musicianship by all involved.\n\nI could happily spend all night going through every single so",

My therapist said when I’m in a deep hole I tend to push myself even deeper because music is my safe space and you can guess what kind of music.\n\nTherefore he suggested happy music, but at first I was skeptical, who wants to hear happy dance music when feeling down?\nBut I found out that NFs latest album is pretty much that. It has a fitting vibe but is about healing and leaving it all behind. Also Anne Maries new song depression has a not so down putting vibe and sound, but it’s just hitting the spot.\n\nNow I’m looking to find more songs that will more likely give me strength than make me even more sad.\n\nSoo please give me ur suggestions!\n(I have a big heart for rap especially)\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone for so many song recommendations! I have so much material to go through which alone will keep me busy which already means a lot to me <3 Can’t wait to find new songs to play up and down. Big thanks!",

That’s why I want to find something for the next time I feel such a way. Plus, that emptiness feeling from such music sometimes just gives me a happier viewpoint on life afterwards, as it ends up cancelling it out sometimes.\n\nNow, “sad” music is something that varies a lot from person to person, and I understand that. For me, I need it to be quite experimental. Chord progression is a very important thing in this case. It can’t be anything crazy mainstream because I’ve probably heard it before. I like stuff with almost a “drone-ish” feel to it, possibly powerful harsh frequency’s that are just a crush to the soul. Usually the longer the song the better too. I know that these are some very odd requests, and that some may think I’m just describing soundtracks for the blind by swans (which is also an AMAZING album) but I gotta find something. If you have anything kinda different from what I stated but you still greatly believe it to be soul crushing, you may still send it as I trust you guys. And if you have any questions, that’s good to.

Music has always been my escape, but lately, it’s been hard to find songs that match where I’m at emotionally. I’m looking for something that hits deep, maybe even sad, but in a way that helps me process things, not just make me feel worse.\n\nCan anyone recommend music that feels like it understands pain, but also brings a sense of peace or hope? Something that might help me get through this, or at least make me feel less alone in the struggle. Thanks in advance.",

EchoesOfVelandria is the channel which initially piqued my interest-  Specifically The Weaver's Song, and now Midnight Market have been problematic ear worms of late.\n\nFor the folks who want to avoid sampling it directly (thereby adding to the consumption of AI content)  the music style is a dark fantasy ballad featuring upper-register female vocals.  The melodies are meant to be  haunting and ethereal with lyrics that tell sad or tragic stories (as ballads oft do).  The instruments are what you'd expect in a folk-fantasy setting - gentle strings like lute and violin along side light percussion like tabor.\n\nHopefully you kind redditors are able to assist me in my quest!  Thanks in advance!\n\n  \nETA:   Y'all definitely gave me some homework to do.  Thank you everyone for your recommendations! A lot of the music is definitely folk ballad, but doesn't quite capture what 'm looking for with the high toned, airy, ethereal (probably because I'm trying to find a perfect fit replacement that may not exist).  Nonetheless, I've got a couple new people to listen to so far.  Thanks again!",

Like if you just said the name of the song I could probably sing most of the song.

Of all the songs I have listened to though I really like ”Plug in baby”, ”The small print” and ”Thoughts of a dying atheist”.\n\nNERIAH:I know and like most of her songs and especially like ”Expiration Date”, ”2008” and ”Sammy”.\n\nLeah Kate: I think I like almost all her songs and I think I could sing a few lines to most of them. I especially like ”Bad taste”, ”Break up SZN” and ”Never been better”.\n\nMckenna Grace: I think I started listening to her when she only had like 4 songs or so and I still listen to her music and think it’s really good. I especially like ”Haunted House”, ”You ruined Nirvana” and ”Bittersweet 16”.\n\nLana Del Rey:I’ve been listening to some of her songs a lot and I don’t know all her songs or anything but the ones I do know I really like. I essentially like ”Radio”, ”Summertime sadness” and ”Dark paradise”.\n\nDepeche Mode:I’ve been listening to this since I was little. My parents like them too and I love many of the songs especially those I grew up lis too. I especially like ”A question of time”, ”Enjoy the silence” and ”Never let me down again”.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo: I really like most of her songs and can relate to multiple of them. I especially like ”Brutal”, ”good for you” and ”jealousy, jealousy”\n\nSneaker pimps:I’ve mostly just listened to the “Splinter” album. But I really liked those songs.

    "selftext": "  \nSo I mostly enjoy progressive rock, soft rock, and some pop from late 70's and early 80's. I generally really enjoy Pink Floyd's catalogue, albums like Tango in the Night by Fleetwood Max, and Roxy Music/Bryan Ferry's catalogue. My favorite songs are usually soft rock, sometimes with a bit of pop or prog rock mixed in. These songs include: Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd, Avalon by Roxy Music, Eyes Without a Face by Billy Idol, Take on Me by A-ha, Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush, It Must have Been Love by Roxette, If You Leave by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and Drive by The Cars.\n\nSo these songs are all either soft rock mixed in with some pop or progressive rock. And I especially like songs like Avalon or Eyes Without a Face that have a melancholic, haunting and dreamy like feel. Some more lightweight feeling music like Fleetwood Mac is probably also fine. Some music like Sting's is too mellow for me though. And most of these songs I listed are obviously very good and either very famous or still popular, so the recommendations probably won't be as good but can you guys still give me some similar songs.",

This extended version is nice to hear and make you want to walk like Peter Parker in Spiderman 3.\n\nStartin' somethin', Michael Jackson (1982), very catchy rythm. The final part of this song just invites to clap to the rythm.\n\nI'm currently looking at playlist from Guardians of the Galaxy and Baby Driver, I'm also checking some Daft Punk, Chemical Brothers and similar. This are some of which I think have some of the mood I'm looking for.\n\nThanks in advance for your suggestions!",

There is not one category in which there aren’t dozens of current artists who outshine her. \n\nSo perhaps it’s not about the music? Maybe it’s precisely _because_ she isn’t outstanding in any area that she appeals so broadly - it makes her relatable? But then why choose her when there are endless mid talents out there to worship? \n\nI loved The Spice Girls and their pop music was fun, catchy, had attitude. I got it. Anyone could see why they stormed pop culture. They were a marketers’ dream but they had truly great pop songs to back it up. \n\nBut what explains the Taylor Swift phenomenon? \n\nDoes anyone else feel like her super mega star status is a bit strange?\n\nEDIT: as a gesture of goodwill to those who insist I am missing her top level songwriting - on my 3 hour drive this week I will put aside my Clipse playlist and have my own TS road trip.

She is simply the best at being bland. And that has wide range appeal. \n\nFrom what I can tell, the themes she writes songs about that people resonate with are the most common denominator themes for people whose height of identity and social interaction was in high school. She has essentially created an image that tells her fans “See? You too can become wildly successful and famous without having to be particularly interesting or talented in any way!” I think this creates a sense of both comfort and possibility in her fans. \n\nSimply put, the majority of people are relatively unremarkable, and Swift has cornered the market in being unremarkable. I think from this last album we can tell that it’s a numbers game. Her defenders say “the album charted” but that doesn’t mean it’s good; when consumption is easily digestible for the masses and the masses have poor taste that is going to equate to massive popularity.",

    "selftext": ">!Round 2 since the first one got deleted.!<\n\nThis phenomenon came to mind re-reading a book I have on the Kinks. The author argues that “Well Respected Man” is “Where the Kinks become the Kinks” and it’s certainly not hard to see how: the character study/social commentary, satirically biting lyrics, and generally je ne sais quoi that just feels so…English.\n\nI thought it was an interesting discussion starter that this sub would appreciate.\n\nAnother one that came to mind for me was “Satisfaction” by The Rolling Stones, riffing off of the braggadocio element of the blues and RnB they were fond of but taking it into their own direction, but I feel like you could make a good argument for “The Last Time” too (if anything, it certainly walked for “Satisfaction” to run).\n\nI think “About a Girl” by Nirvana fits the shoe (I’m sorry) too: it’s Cobain finally not feeling afraid of flexing his pop muscles, much to the benefit of rock history. And as much as I love the heavy weirdness of the stuff before the song (your Mexican Seafood’s, Paper Cuts’, and If You Must’s), it was probably a move for the better.\n\nI feel like it’s hard to pick one for the Beatles because not only did they keep changing so much, the change was a gradual one. But I’ve heard “Ticket to Ride” singles out as an interesting turning point where they’re *really* starting to mess with what a pop song could be and I can sort of see it too. They'd done experimentation before (i.e. the feedback at the beginning of \"I Feel Fine\", unorthodox chord changes), but \"Ticket to Ride\" sees them messing with a myriad of different things within one song without sacrificing their pop craftsmanship: the drum pattern, droning, overall heavy feeling of it, and the runtime being longer than 3 minutes.\n\nI found it to be an interesting phenomenon, albeit a purely subjective one to some degree.

However, this is where his production really comes into its own, and the sound collages and the sources he samples from here are the beginnings of quintessential DOOM. KMD sounded completely different, and Operation Doomsday, although solid, is only the beginning of him fleshing out his post-KMD sound, you can see the ideas that defined DOOM but I'd argue it doesnt get realized til this release.\n\nEarl Sweatshirt - Some Rap Songs - all his releases up til this album have been getting closer to hinting in the direction this album would take, but after this came out, Earl has firmly settled in his niche and owns it. Plus, it seems like every release he's made after is treading the same ground Some Rap Songs established.",

I find him to be one of the most interesting, complex, difficult-to-pin down human beings on planet earth, and I am saying that from the perspective of a non-superfan who does love a handful of Coldplay songs (Square One! Don't Panic! Arabesque! A L I E N S!) but otherwise gets icked out by a lot of their music and by the man who sings it. The rest of the band seem to be relatively normal people despite their immense wealth/status, I have no problem with any of them. Chris on the other hand...\n\nTo be clear this is not an 'oldplay better' post. They've made good music early on and they've made good music recently. This is a discussion about Chris Martin the man. I think he's the most bizarre pop culture figure of all time\n\nChris Martin is not a natural pop star. Point blank, period. In theory he is so deeply unremarkable. He is the kind of man who you'd expect to be your slightly odd coworker at an accounting firm in Staines-Upon-Thames. He is gangly, uncoordinated, sort-of-good-looking-but-sort-of-not, thoroughly middle class, is mostly quiet and awkward in interviews (but never so on stage), has an odd, nervous style of speaking full of halting pauses (but never so on stage), tends towards vague platitudes in his lyrics, and has a very unimpressive vocal range. He is firmly ensconced in the 'decent songwriter' tier. He is someone who in 999,999 out of 1,000,000 universes would be a middle manager somewhere in rainy middle England who does pub gigs on Saturday nights with a band less talented than he is. \n\nYet somehow, through sheer chance and a little bit of hard work, he ended up in the right place at the right time to be the biggest rock star in the world.\n\nTo be clear, there are many people who sing in bands I'm indifferent to where I look at them and I think – *oh yeah, THAT dude has the IT factor*. *THAT* dude was always meant to be a star. Matt Bellamy is the sort of",

As I see it, Chris Martin was just a rather posh but ordinary, middle class student, somewhat introvert, reflective and awkward, who listened to Radiohead and Travis and U2 and wrote some songs - and then through luck and timing and a bit of a knack for trend-following, has found himself being a world famous star. So he tries to act like one, but I think in himself is really a bit stuck as that insecure student. \n\nThere are parallels, I think, with other very middle class students from England who embraced fame in America - Sting, maybe. Or even David Gilmore. \n\nI think i'd be the same in his situation - yeah, I'd take up the chance to embrace the money and the lifestyle, but I'm just a quiet, geeky, unassuming Brit - I'd feel out of place and awkward with the fame, and I'd just try and act my way through it, playing the part, as part of my job.",

I'll just recommend 2 things if you really want to understand better how Chris \"works\" and how he became who he is:\n\n* Pete Holmes' podcast \"You Made It Weird\" with Chris as a guest, September 2021. Chris talks in great lengths about what fuels/fuelled him to become who he is, and his relationship with fame.\n* The A Head Full of Dreams documentary made by Mat Whitecross in 2018.\n\nThese will explain better than me that talent really hasn't got anything to do with fame, first and foremost. If you really get into Coldplay and their philosophy nowadays (since the last 5 albums I'd say), you get to see that despite the whole rock star thing and despite all the weirdness one might see in him, Chris is probably the most down to earth and human person I know of. That is ultimately what I am fascinated about and what helps them \"own\" every stadium they play to.",

Every artist is seemingly pivoting to country, and indie music has been leading that charge for a few years now. So what better time to have a rate focusing on some of the genre's old classics? Welcome to the Alt-Country/Folk Classics rate!\n \n**Wait… what are rates?**\n \nAbout once a month, r/indieheads has a game where we pick themes of albums from a genre/era/etc and then rate the albums in those themes. In the rate, you will be rating each song from 1-10 (along with the opportunity to give one song a 0 and another song an 11) and then submitting your ballot to the hosts. Those ballots are then tallied up and over a few days those results are revealed with the lowest rated songs being revealed first and the best saved for last. \n \n**How do I participate?**\n \n[Submit your ballot here!](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=MCK_OH&subject=Alt-Country%2FFolk%20Rate&message=Username%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20American%20Water%0A%0ARandom%20Rules%3A%20%0A%0ASmith%20%26%20Jones%20Forever%3A%0A%0ANight%20Society%3A%0A%0AFederal%20Dust%3A%0A%0APeople%3A%0A%0ABlue%20Arrangements%3A%0A%0AWe%20Are%20Real%3A%0A%0ASend%20In%20The%20Clouds%3A%0A%0ALike%20like%20the%20the%20the%20Death%3A%0A%0ABuckingham%20Rabbit%3A%0A%0AHonk%20If%20You're%20Lonely%3A%0A%0AThe%20Wild%20Kindness%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Decoration%20Day%0A%0AThe%20Deeper%20In%3A%0A%0ASinkhole%3A%0A%0AHell%20No%2C%20I%20Ain't%20Happy%3A%0A%0AMarry%20Me%3A%0A%0AMy%20Sweet%20Annette%3A%0A%0AOutfit%3A%0A%0AHeathens%3A%0A%0ASounds%20Better%20in%20the%20Song%3A%0A%0A%28Something's%20Got%20To%29%20Give%20Pretty%20Soon%3A%0A%0AYour%20Daddy%20Hates%20Me%3A%0A%0ACareless%3A%0A%0AWhen%20The%20Pin%20Hits%20the%20Shell%3A%0A%0ADo%20It%20Yourself%3A%0A%0ADecoration%20Day%3A%0A%0ALoaded%20Gun%20in%20the%20Closet%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Magnolia%20Electric%20Co.%0A%0AFarewell%20Transmission%3A%0A%0AI've%20Been%20Riding%20With%20the%20Ghost%3",

    "selftext": "As someone who is a huge Celine Dion fan I never realized that the type of music and charts she dominated was Adult Contemporary. I remember as a kid always hearing her music whenever I was at the pharmacy, malls, supermarkets, airports, and those car rides home after shopping. For some odd reason other artists started trickling into my own head and I started to recite lyrics or barely and just remembering them whenever I heard them again somewhere in my family daily errand travels. I found out what Adult Contemporary was once Wikipedia started posting chart position of singles from my favorite artists and seeing where their singles landed on those charts.\n\nBut AC music was a group of different genres that has an easy listening aspect to them. You weren't head banging to a rock song but you were listening and alt rock or soft rock in the back ground if Matchbox 20 was playing \"Unwell\" seeing if you could swindle your parents into buying something you didn't need. Or maybe your parents turned on the radio after doing some shopping on an early Saturday afternoon and their favorite Wilson Phillips song came on before leaving the parking lot. These type of songs always had an imprint in your head from little moments that you could only just live in pure serenity. \n\nBut over the past 15 years or so this type of music has been all but gone. The only current artists, I could say that has a type of AC feel to their music is Adele, P!nk, and Kelly Clarkson. But again AC is a bunch of different genres that range from soft, alt, and even standard rock songs, all the way to some power ballads, and even quiet storm R&B, along with regular pop songs. \n\nSo what do I think are the causes for AC decline? I think one cause is that music is now being streamed which results into trendy songs taking place from the radio. People don't listen to what a radio host or DJ has to play, but more so what an algorithm has to show you. Online shopping has taken a lot away from people going into s",

    "title": "Is \"Broken Wings\" by Mr. Mister a good song? ",
    "selftext": "This is kind of a weird topic, but I’m bored and need to figure out how I actually feel about Broken Wings by Mr. Mister. It’s such a strange song to me—there’s something about it that doesn’t sit comfortably, and I can’t tell if that’s a good thing or not.For one, the song doesn’t resolve. The whole thing feels like a sustained buildup without ever delivering that big, satisfying payoff. The verses and chorus revolve around minor and suspended chords, which create this sense of tension and yearning. But these progressions never fully resolve to the tonic in a traditional way. It leaves me feeling emotionally incomplete, and I’m not sure if I love or hate that.\n\nPart of me respects how unique it is, but part of me feels like it’s the musical equivalent of blue balls.The melody itself is beautiful, but it deliberately avoids obvious melodic resting points. And Richard Page’s vocals—great voice, by the way—only lean further into that unresolved feeling. He’s often singing on ascending or suspended notes, which just keeps the tension going.\n\nThe song never really hits a climactic moment; instead, it rides this steady intensity that feels like it’s always leading somewhere but never quite arriving.Then there’s the outro. It just fades out with repeated lines and instrumental motifs, offering no definitive conclusion. It’s like the song wants you to stay in this unresolved state even after it’s over.I’ve noticed how divisive this song is. Some people absolutely love it, while others consider it one of the weakest No. 1 hits of the 80s.\n\nHonestly, I’m not surprised it’s so polarising. It’s a very well-arranged, well-executed track, but that lack of resolution makes it kind of an emotional Rubik’s Cube.And as for me? I’m still conflicted. My friends and family aren’t much help either—they think I’m stupid for even overthinking this song of all songs so much. Guess I’ll just keep listening and see if it finally clicks—or keeps driving me nuts.\n\nEdit: OK, I figured it out. A",

    "selftext": "Hi - I revisited Transmissions from the Satellite Heart & Clouds Taste Metallic on the way home from work today, and I thought “WOW!”. Always liked the Flaming Lips ever since my high school days (I was born in 1996). The Soft Bulletin & Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots are wonderful albums for sure, but I want to give a shout out to the Ronald Jones era of the Flaming Lips. \n\n(Ronald Jones was a guitarist for the Flaming Lips from the early to mid-90s - he is on Transmissions from the Satellite Heart & Clouds Taste Metallic) \n\nThe Ronald Jones era was so charming to me. Adorable & even uplifting in a sense….reminded me of a child with a huge smile, hugging people constantly & having so much love to give out. Upbeat without being cloying. The Soft Bulletin definitely has a more serious & existential tone to it - which is definitely not a bad thing - but I appreciate how Transmissions from the Satellite Heart & Clouds Taste Metallic are more fun & playful. \n\nAnd songs like “Pilot Can at the Queer of God”, “Be My Head”, “Kim’s Watermelon Gun” & “Psychiatric Explorations of the Fetus with Needles” are noisy….but not in an overly brutal way! Bands such as the Jesus Lizard, Big Black, Lightning Bolt, the Birthday Party & Swans could be described as “ugly”, “filthy”, “scary”, “intense”, “hateful” even….and I definitely like those bands a lot. But Transmissions from the Satellite Heart & Clouds Taste Metallic are far from (again) “scary” & “hateful”. Those albums are full of good-natured fun. The kind of music that genuinely makes me smile….and there’s that lovely juxtaposition of sweet melodies with feedback & ear-splitting noise. \n\nRonald Jones is an incredible guitarist too….somehow creating sounds that I thought were impossible to achieve beforehand. The extended freak-out during the outro of “Turn It On”, everything about “Kim’s Watermelon Gun”, those brief bursts of noise in “This Here Giraffe”, what *could* be a slide guitar in “She Don’t Use Jelly”…..I could go on a",

    "selftext": "Please forgive any typos! I wrote this essay to try and capture my thoughts as I listened to the album:\n\n\\###\n\nIn 1966, Kinks frontman and songwriter Ray Davies was at a creative crossroads. Though the Kinks were always seen in popular culture as the natural competitor to fellow Brits the Beatles, Davies didn’t see himself as McCartney, Lennon, Harrison, or Starr.\n\nIn his mind, he was Brian Wilson. And the Kinks were capable of becoming the Beach Boys.\n\nAfter the release of the Beach Boys’ creative apex, “Pet Sounds,” Davies was feeling the pull to truly explore the farthest reaches of his creative impulses. He yearned for the creative freedom outside of the guitar-driven, straight forward rock of the old Kinks. \n\nBut at the same time, he was acutely aware that their more accessible early hits —  like “You Really Got Me” and “All Day and All Night” — were the proverbial moneymakers, drawing the crowds that allowed the Kinks to exist as one of the most prominent (if dwindling) stars of britrock in the world. So Davies tried an arrangement modeled after Wilson: Davies would stop touring with the Kinks altogether, sending someone as a replacement so he could stay home and focus on the creative future of the Kinks. \n\nAfter the release of the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful album “Something Else,” he began working on a performance art piece centered around the “Village Green,” a pastoral slice of nostalgia built around character studies of individuals living in a small British town where the “old ways” still dominated the culture. It was basically Twin Peaks, but for quaint, village life Britain before life got so complicated. In her book about the Kinks, Dr. Carey Fleiner describes the concept of the Village Green as a prominent addition to the trend of \"heritage escapism\" that was sweeping England at the time.\n\nHe originally thought this Village Green project might be a piece of musical theater, or possibly a TV special, before settling on a solo alb",

My hope in posting this was that I'd get thoughtful responses to pressure test my ideas, so thank you for that!\n\nI think my big takeaway is that I think I've overstated the prevalence of the negative aspects of nostalgia I see in the overarching themes of \"Village Green.\" While I do still believe he's generally skeptical of nostalgia, based in large part on where he was artistically at the time and constraints he felt himself under while writing \"VG,\" perhaps I'd be more accurate in saying that the album is a meditation on nostalgia in general - both the good and the bad.\n\nThat's where I think \"Do You Remember Walter\" and \"Johnny Thunder\" come in. \"Johnny\" is the quintessential tall tale that gets told in small town (having grown up in one myself, I know these well). Meanwhile, I do see some of the themes I discussed cropping up in \"Walter:\"\n\n*\"And you're always home in bed by half past eight.*  \n*And if I talked about the old times, you'd get bored*  \n*And you'd have nothing more to say.\"*\n\nI think we see two sides of the same coin in this song: On one, the narrator who yearns for the past and to relive old memories, and with Walter we have someone who has moved on. The narrator wants Walter to be someone he isn't anymore - nor does Walter have any interest in being again.\n\n(Let me add here, I promise I didn't omit mentioning either song because it didn't fit my argument. I just didn't thinking listing every song would make for a very compelling read, so I called out what I thought were the most interesting examples.)\n\nNow, on the \"Steam Powered Train,\" I think we disagree a little more distinctly.\n\n*\"In terms of how it fits into the album it's saying that Davies as a musician can \"live in a museum.\"*\n\nDavies was roughly 22 when this album was written, and he was experiencing a well-documented artistic rut caused by his perceived limitations of the Kinks' sound.

A lot of it is very sincere. \n\nLater, on their Preservation Act albums you see the same kind of sentiment and disdain for developers and \"tearing down little houses to build tenement buildings.\" Like [Demolition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jlwzfPhsKM) where there's a direct callback to Village Green.  \n\nBut that theme was in a lot of music at that time, Joni's Big Yellow Taxi, or Steve Miller's Going to the Country off the top of my head.

    "selftext": "I'm a die hard fan of Kendrick Lamar and I have been since 2011. His music has grown up with me, and watching him soar to the heights of influence and respect that he's at now has been such a fun ride to witness. I wrote the following essay to explore my admiration for him as an influential artist in my life. When he was announced for the Super Bowl, I knew he'd deliver a stunning show. I think he did...do you? \n\nIf you didn't enjoy the show, why not? Is it because you're largely not into Hip Hop/Rap? Do you not like \"music numbers/routines\"? I'm genuinely curious about what people who didn't enjoy the show particularly *didn't* enjoy about it. \n\nBut also, has anyone else been a long time, devoted fan of K.dot's?? How good was 2024???\n\nLet's talk!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBut first, here's my essay, I hope you enjoy reading. \n\n# Kendrick Lamar & The Super Bowl: On Being a Longtime, White Guy Fan\n\n\n\nAlright, let me get my [K.dot](http://K.dot) bonafides in order immediately: the first Kendrick track I ever heard was “HiiiPower.” The lead single off his first studio album with TDE — *Section.80 —* from my birthday month of July, all the way back in 2011. I was *transfixed* by that song. It flew open my eyes to the history of Black revolutionaries like Fred Hampton and reignited my interest in Malcom X’s politics and in him as a man. It powerfully pronounced the social, historical, and world altering attitude of a bold new artist. And the J. Cole produced beat and Kendrick’s flow are still *so good*. I fell in love on first listen while driving home from Clemson University’s library late at night, listening on Shade 45 while I had a 90-day free trial of satellite radio. The song shook me — I was an *instant* fan.\n\nWhen I got home, I went to my room, got on my laptop ",

I'm not arguing doing the Super Bowl as being the only and final measure as to Kendrick's, or anyone's, quality, I just think its worth celebrating and thinking about. It's a big deal.
