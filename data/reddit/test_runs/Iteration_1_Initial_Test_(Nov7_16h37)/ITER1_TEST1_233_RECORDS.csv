Slow building, somewhat gothic, atmospheric and emotionally charged. So...

Tool - Wings For Marie / 10,000 Days (back to back is the only way to listen to these)

As with many of Maynard's songs, this tackles his mother's unwavering piousness in the face of her disability, and his cynicism towards it. It's climax is unrelenting. I was also tempted to recommend The Noose by A Perfect Circle (another of his bands) which deals with similar themes.

Porcupine Tree - Anesthetize

Slow building and dark, this song captures individual loneliness and mental struggle in the midst of a fractured, cathode-drowned society. If you like it, I'd recommend Russia on Ice for it's slow build, or shesmoviedon for it's perfect solo.

Manchester Orchestra - The Silence

Slow building and powerful - an introspective look at escaping the shackles of genetic inheritance. Andy Hull's vocals are, a bit like Jeff's, mesmerising and overwhelming in their beauty. Other songs I'd recommend are Rear View and Dinosaur.

Josh Ritter - Dreams

Bit more folky than the rest, this one looks at depression. His lyrical prowess is on display here - the imagery is incredible. He hasn't really done any others like it.

The Decemberists - The Island...

One of those breaking the mould prog tracks from a classically folk outfit - this is a retelling of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Joan in the Garden is their other similar track.

Typhoon - Ariadne

The closer on a brilliant album about spiralling dementia - dark, brooding and wonderfully orchestral. If you like it... the whole album is a journey to it I'd recommend taking. And their other albums (although less brooding). I could wax lyrical all day tbh.

Hope you like these!"

The closer on a brilliant album about spiralling dementia - dark, brooding and wonderfully orchestral. If you like it... the whole album is a journey to it I'd recommend taking. And their other albums (although less brooding). I could wax lyrical all day tbh.

Hope you like these!"

Old Time Religion by Parker Millsap is about misinterpreting the Bible and is more folksy sounding.

He's incredibly eclectic in his instrumentation, sampling, background vocals etc. A joy to listen to and just feels like an expert in his field.

Bon Iver - 22, A Million is a tour de force in music production and layering of sounds. A crowning achievement of a record that I don't think he'll eclipse.

Villagers is brilliant for pushing boundaries and blending genres - lots of piano, strings and electronic sampling mixed in. Sometimes sounds timeless, sometimes like house music. Connor really broke from his acoustic folk sound from his earliest album and seems to be doing what he wants beyond the confines of genre.

Those are three that spring to mind on the topic of 'textured' music. I could offer a lot more but you're going to get a lot of recommendations so I'll hold off."

Not even sad, things with weight that move me the right way. Always felt self conscious about it, but thankfully I can only really experience that if the content has my full attention. So, I'm alone when it happens.

I don't know if my response aligns with the music's tone perfectly, as much as I select music that doesn't emotionally clash too hard with my state. So, being chronically depressed, drone/ambient, doom metal, and stoner metal seems to work for me pretty much any time.

Music's kinda supposed to affect you emotionally, although I suppose the stuff that gets hits isn't going to hit that deep for many. Need to find more specific stuff that resonates with ye. Here I am listening to a drone track by Hakita whose only instrument is Hatsune Miku, massively pitched and slowed."

One of the most gorgeous, transportatively nostalgic albums ever. If you’ve ever wanted to know what a contemplative night walk in London in the early noughties sounded like, it’s that. 

Reflections After Jane in particular is so meaningful to me."

I also think, musically, it's no slouch. There's some really intense guitar playing on it."

I do a playlist called [Singled Out](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0QGts9ViNDZOU2VGCJzMya?si=GxGb_0ZfR_-t2j5owmkrzQ) of new release singles of the week for the whole year.  I update it every Friday if anyone's interested.  The first **13** tracks are for this week.  Everything after that is previous weeks going back to the first of the year.  


**Highlights This Week: ** Baltimore, Md. Neo-Psych  band **Animal Collective** drop *Buddies On the Blackboard* the B-Side to June's release of *Love On the Big Screen*.


London, UK Alt-R&B musician **Nourished by Time / Marcus Brown** releases the 3rd cut *Baby Baby* from his upcoming LP *The Passionate Ones* due **Aug 22**.  This has been my fav of his new tracks, sick beat on here. Really lookin forward to the whole album.


Nashville, Tn. Egg-Punk crew **Snõõper** just released the manic fun *Unknown Caller EP* at the end of June.  This week they hit us with *Worldwide* the title track for their upcoming sophomore LP due **Oct 3.**  I've had this track on on repeat pretty much since it posted.


Baltimore, Md. Indie-Rock band **Teen Suicide** drop a duo of new tracks *Fade 2 Blue* a fuzzed out ripper & *New Tattoo* a solid Lo-Fi bedroom acoustic cut. Really enjoyed both of these.

Hardcore Coldplay fan here, especially of Chris, so I thought I'd put  in my 2 cents. I'll just recommend 2 things if you really want to understand better how Chris ""works"" and how he became who he is:

* Pete Holmes' podcast ""You Made It Weird"" with Chris as a guest, September 2021. Chris talks in great lengths about what fuels/fuelled him to become who he is, and his relationship with fame.
* The A Head Full of Dreams documentary made by Mat Whitecross in 2018.

These will explain better than me that talent really hasn't got anything to do with fame, first and foremost. If you really get into Coldplay and their philosophy nowadays (since the last 5 albums I'd say), you get to see that despite the whole rock star thing and despite all the weirdness one might see in him, Chris is probably the most down to earth and human person I know of. That is ultimately what I am fascinated about and what helps them ""own"" every stadium they play to."

In 1966, Kinks frontman and songwriter Ray Davies was at a creative crossroads. Though the Kinks were always seen in popular culture as the natural competitor to fellow Brits the Beatles, Davies didn’t see himself as McCartney, Lennon, Harrison, or Starr.

In his mind, he was Brian Wilson. And the Kinks were capable of becoming the Beach Boys.

My hope in posting this was that I'd get thoughtful responses to pressure test my ideas, so thank you for that!

I think my big takeaway is that I think I've overstated the prevalence of the negative aspects of nostalgia I see in the overarching themes of ""Village Green."" While I do still believe he's generally skeptical of nostalgia, based in large part on where he was artistically at the time and constraints he felt himself under while writing ""VG,"" perhaps I'd be more accurate in saying that the album is a meditation on nostalgia in general - both the good and the bad.

That's where I think ""Do You Remember Walter"" and ""Johnny Thunder"" come in. ""Johnny"" is the quintessential tall tale that gets told in small town (having grown up in one myself, I know these well). Meanwhile, I do see some of the themes I discussed cropping up in ""Walter:""

*""And you're always home in bed by half past eight.*  
*And if I talked about the old times, you'd get bored*  
*And you'd have nothing more to say.""*

I think we see two sides of the same coin in this song: On one, the narrator who yearns for the past and to relive old memories, and with Walter we have someone who has moved on. The narrator wants Walter to be someone he isn't anymore - nor does Walter have any interest in being again.

(Let me add here, I promise I didn't omit mentioning either song because it didn't fit my argument. I just didn't thinking listing every song would make for a very compelling read, so I called out what I thought were the most interesting examples.)

Now, on the ""Steam Powered Train,"" I think we disagree a little more distinctly.

*""In terms of how it fits into the album it's saying that Davies as a musician can ""live in a museum.""*

Davies was roughly 22 when this album was written, and he was experiencing a well-documented artistic rut caused by his perceived limitations of the Kinks' sound. He was an open fan of Brian Wilson's more limit-pushing instrumentation and wante"

You can see it as well in songs like Picture Book and People Take Pictures of Each Other. Or Animal Farm. A lot of it is very sincere. 

Later, on their Preservation Act albums you see the same kind of sentiment and disdain for developers and ""tearing down little houses to build tenement buildings."" Like [Demolition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jlwzfPhsKM) where there's a direct callback to Village Green.
