Can absolutely ","Was going to recommend The Oh Hellos! Their whole Dear Wormwood album is inspired by CS Lewis’s writing so you’ll definitely get a lot of religious allusions and undertones there. 

A lot of Twenty One Pilots songs also deal with struggling with belief I feel like? Songs like Doubt, Trees, and Implicit Demand for Proof fit that although they’re not acoustic. 

Old Time Religion by Parker Millsap is about misinterpreting the Bible and is more folksy sounding. 

Radical Face is one of my favorite "

Someone recently told me about this song, and it's soooo awesome!!!!

It's an absolutely unique blend of different vocals, rap without the annoying hi-hat, and wonderful instrumentals. Extremely dynamic, never boring. Doja Cat's vocals absolutely shine through full of life, without being boxed in by intense music.

Absolutely love how the music is so powerful but not overbearing.

I feel like this does get some attention, but I don't see it come up as a classic as much as it should. It's a beautiful album both lyrically, but also emotively. There's a real rawness to the way Scott sings, and there's some songs on it that still nearly 20 years later make me feel things.

I also think, musically, it's no slouch. There's some really intense guitar playing on it."
