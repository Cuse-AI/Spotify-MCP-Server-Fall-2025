I have a pinch of time, to give this a go again! Please give me **ONE** **SONG**. It will be added to a playlist. No artist can be repeated. I'll reply if your artist is taken. Give me any artist you want, one song.  Give me a song you think, even though the artist might be popular, the song is not, but you love it. Perhaps give me an artist you think nobody knows. I'll be double-checking nobody posts twice; one shot, make it good! Should you be interested, a result is here: [Reddit playlist Vol. 2](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3mZaEp2l6VfJm1tclaQBXw?si=51ebc16807c44ebb) Thanks for adding!\n\nEdit: Goodness such a task! 130+ songs after 5 hours.

      "full_context": "A playlist: One song, one artist..... I'd like to make a playlist: that you fellow redditors will concoct: comment **one** artist, **one** song of theirs.\n\nThe playlist *will not* add more than **one** song from that artist. So, I will let you know if that artist has already been claimed. If you want, just comment **one** other artist and their **one** track. I also will try to make it only **one** suggestion per user. So, only **one** song per comment please. I'll ignore comments who lists more than one song. The Spotify playlist can be found [HERE](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1vSE2EqCSlSA2TRSEvDmvK?si=2d968f0958394343).\n\nLet's see how this goes. Care to play along?\n\nEdit 1: I’m loving the response so far! Thank you all!!! Very eclectic mix. I will be METICULOUSLY checking no artist repeats, and no user puts in twice. I may not catch it at first, but any second entries will simply come off. No harm, no foul. Thanks again!!\n\nEdit 2: Day 2, I'm about 180 songs in. thanks. If you think you need  to search for the artist in the comments, don't worry, I'll do that for you and just let you know if you've duplicated and try again.\n\nEdit 3: apparently playlist curating requests are good for small artists, so I have discovered! which is ok with me. 219 songs put into this. This will lose much more traction soon. It was fun.. Stolen Prayer by Alice Cooper",

This is gonna be a ramble so TLDR: need songs that expresses the pain of a breakup with someone you still love, will never stop loving, and never want to stop, but still want to find a way to move on.  \n\n\nI’ve officially had to let go of who I truly thought was/would be the love of my life/life partner because of things mostly out of both of our control.  Again.   But this time, it’s probably forever.  \n\nWe were together once, and although it was truly the best I’ve ever had, it ultimately didn’t work due to a lot of things. Spent significant time in no contact, reconnected 9 months ago, been in contact as something between friends and partners since.  Working on ourselves both individually and together, making so many amazing changes.  Knowing we still love each other with every fiber of each of our beings.  Yet still, so much has caught up to us and it’s like our past is just hanging over us.  We realized tonight that we can’t continue on like this because it’s bringing so much pain to us both despite all our best efforts.  I know it’s the right choice for both of us, but “crushed” and “heartbroken” don’t even begin to cover how I’m feeling.  I will never be able to describe how I feel about him and how I have since the day we met.  \n\nAll that said, I need songs to help me process the pain of the parting ways, and essentially breaking up again, in ways that still acknowledge and honor that I still do and always will love him.  Thank you.\n\nEdit: thanks already for so many amazing suggestions.  I’m working my way through them and adding them to the playlist.

I'm trying to make a playlist for someone and got curious if there's any songs where the love interest is either explicitly mentioned/implied to be a person of colour?

It was a side project by three members of Duran Duran. They produced one album, “So Red The Rose”. Although still poppy 80s music, it was a bit more ambitious. For me, it was the last great album to come out at the height of Duran Duran’s popularity. Their single “Goodbye Is Forever” is one of my all time favourite songs. \n\nThat said, it doesn’t sound like “Come Undone” which has strong Madchester vibes. If you want to go down that rabbit hole, start with The Stone Roses “Fool’s Gold”.",

I think the artist you're looking for is David Bazan who also went by Pedro the Lion.  His first cd is very christian and he was super young (18-early 20s) when he composed it.  A few years later he left christianity and had a very bad relationship with his wife and they got divorced.  This coincided with my own walking away from \"faith.\"  One of his best songs is [Priests & Paramedics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tbNEt67M3o) where a man gets stabbed by his wife and is in shock asking the paramedics assisting him if he is about to die.  I had a male friend who accepted he was an atheist after hearing that song.  He also has a song about sex called [Rapture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45G7Vxb5DTI), but estrangement from god/religion comes through in most of his albums/lyrics.  Highly recommend!",

I find so much good new music by participating in these threads and listening to what others recommend.\n\nHere is yet another (for when you have time): [Bel Canto - The Suffering](https://youtu.be/Ik4GuD7aZ-M?list=OLAK5uy_mUZs3ubaX1NNItAXyrCHxUEwQNclOjTFM) The singer, Anneli Drecker is one of my favorites. She uses her voice very expressively to evoke longing. Another in that direction is [Without You](https://youtu.be/llRW86iUmi0?list=OLAK5uy_kasxGTq7NGoxiNyPC-f4uOPjJLUffaFPw) where you can just feel the rejection and emptiness she sings of. Again goosebumps. My favorite song by her is a very dreamy ballad in German called [Ladonia](https://youtu.be/1ZD_L6MXIXY?list=OLAK5uy_kCchlyv2-4yPsRTbNaimg_eGKWxtZzmyo). It is again romantic longing for someone she can only dream about being with... the song ends on an exhale that really gets to me.",

Here’s what I have so far—hopefully this gives you a sense of the vibe I’m after:  \n\nChad Valley – Shell Suite  \nGoldroom – Fifteen  \nLocal Natives – Dark Days  \nWashed Out – Feel It All Around  \nNeon Indian – Polish Girl  \nM83 – Midnight City  \nPierce Fulton – Autumn Blossom  \n. Is it ok if i only put pop songs? I'll put the links to youtube as i don't have spotify:\n\n[Maybe, Maybe - A-ha](https://youtube.com/watch?v=zA2twJ4Vd2I&si=D132H75fBvPEyObg)\n\n[Make it - Jake Reese](https://youtube.com/watch?v=lv5D0r2AgF4&si=_1EnoY-2FqCDffm3)\n\n[Empty handed - Michelle Branch](https://youtube.com/watch?v=c_Xe-gMhh5s&si=btAVf4WsPo4IhF2T)\n\n[Beautiful Morning - Take That](https://youtube.com/watch?v=uoKcAPDuMJU&si=5Io-SGWe2c_A1nqm)\n\n[Rio](https://youtube.com/watch?v=oIxLhALHu80&si=MuOb9H8F8tXrFI6m) and [World](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1HhQ9nf5hGE&si=qehS_-1YypNvVoS8) by Mark Owen\n\nI have more but i rather be brief hahaha",

I have Apply music for free (I’m an Apple user) and I have a free trial for Tidal.  I already have moved my playlists and songs to each app from Spotify. My most important features I look for are: \n\n• Recommending new music based on what I listen to\n\n• The app creating new mixes for me\n\n• A-release radar \n\n• Ensuring new music appears on the app at specific times (I.e. if a new album drops at midnight it will show on the app at midnight). \n\n I really love Spotify and its ease of use as well as quick the algorithm is in finding new music I like.\n\nBased on all this info can you give me your recommendations on which app to switch to between Apple Music or Tidal? Thanks! \n. It makes no actual sense to leave Spotify for their \"activities\" while typing from an iPhone or using Apple Music. \n\nApple's CEO donated $1,000,000 to the current administration, and literally gifted the current president a GOLD trophy.",

I skip around to the chorus, figure out in 10 seconds if I like it, then add it to one of my many playlists.

I just find myself skipping to the best part, and then I move onto my next favorite song, listen to the best part, skip to my next favorite song just to hear the best part, etc, etc. I can do this for hours. I can go through a 100 of my favorite songs jumping between all the different genres just to \"remember\" what that song sounded like.  Maybe I'm just addicted to that little dopamine I get when I hear my favorite part. \n\n  \nDo any of you have this issue? I only have this issue when I'm using my laptop. I don't skip songs like this in the car or while I'm really focused in the office. I never skip when I'm listening to music with someone else too. How do y'all fix this bad habit. I've had this habit for years, it's nothing new, but lately I'm realizing maybe it's a bad thing. . I kind of do the same. Only difference is I sometimes will jump to the last minute of a song to see if there is a change in tempo. I listen to a lot of indie music as of late and a lot of bands that I listen to like to change tempo. Quick example,there is a song by starfucker called hotel New Jersey. I use to skip the song because I didn't like the start but it changes in the chorus and the end is even better. So yeah I'm weird like that too.",

Are there playlists, communities, or methods you use that don't feel so overwhelming?\n\nAny suggestions for specific songs, albums, or even strategies would be super appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!. Sorry in advance for the length of this. Jump to the third paragraph below for specific suggestions based on  bands you listed (e.g., Of Monsters and Men, Arctic Monkeys):\n\nI had this problem too. The way I overcame it was to pay attention to what was drawing me in the songs I did like and give that quality a name. This helped me recognize it in a more conscious way so that it could become something I could listen for. Once I did this, it became much easier for me to detect this quality when I scanned through new music.\n\nHere's an example: [Nimble](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/72IFsjh0fDGX39uLocWyWr?si=d59b94e6f42a4313). This is a sprightly, light-footed quality in music. In terms of timbre and rhythm, it is like a fairy--fast, light, fluttery, delicate. For some reason this is a quality I'm drawn to in music, but it doesn't already exist as a genre, so I had to discover it for myself. I did this by adding any song that gave me this feeling to a playlist. It started with 1 song (the first in the playlist), and has now built up to 27. Over time, the essential quality uniting these songs became more apparent, and I came to realize \"this is something I really like.\" I'm really good at spotting it now when listening to new music, and its led me into genres I didn't used to listen to, like hyper-pop.\n\nSo going off of what you said above, you're already doing something like that with Of Monsters and Men. You gave it the name \"whimsical folk-ish.\" I'm guessing there's a quality you recognize in their music, that you are giving that name to. I might create a playlist like that: \"Whimsical Folkish.\" Can you think of an image that captures this same quality? Make that the cover image--the cover will help you sustain focus on the quality. I actually look at my playlist covers when I listen to them because they help me recognize the quality each playlist is built around.\n\nThen write a blurb that captures whatever it is that draws you to this whimsical folkish type sound. Like the picture, this helps you sustain focus on this quality.

Here's one strategy: type \"Of Monsters and Men\" into the search bar. Click on their name and once you get to their page on the site, click \"recommended songs based on Of Monsters and Men.\" This will give you a bunch of songs to explore. Mouse over them to listen to snippets of each song. See if anything in the 30-second snippet gives you that \"whimsical folkish\" feeling. If so, add it to the playlist for deeper listening later.\n\nYou could do something similar with the Arctic Monkeys song. What is it you like about that song in particular? Can you recognize the quality you're responding to? Give it a name and build a playlist for it with just that one song in it. Then go to Discover Quickly, search for that song and when you find it, click \"recommended songs based on this.\" Start scanning through them, adding any song that gives you a similar feeling to the playlist. If none of the songs offered give you that feeling, click the refresh button (curved arrow above top row of songs offered) to get more.\n\nYou're building out from what you already like, further differentiating it and using it as a bridge into new music . This helped me expand my taste from indie-rock into pop, country, hip-hop and r&b. If you look at my [playlist library](https://open.spotify.com/user/apeiron101?si=ac4fe90ff27946d2), all but the first and last one are build around a specific quality in the way I'm describing.

I really want to venture out into other genres, but I honestly don't know where to start. Every time I try, I just feel overwhelmed by the endless amount of music out there.\n\nSome context about my taste:\n\nI've enjoyed J-rock, especially Radwimps (mainly their movie albums).\n\nI'm into metal along the lines of Galneryus - \"Attitude to Life\" is a favorite.\n\nI weirdly loved \"I Wanna Be Yours\" by Arctic Monkeys, but for some reason, I couldn't connect with any of their other songs in the same way.\n\nI like whimsical folk-ish sounds, something like Of Monsters and Men.\n\nAnd the only music I know I'll consistently enjoy is film soundtracks from Malayalam movies I love.\n\nThe problem is: when I try to explore, I end up trudging through album after album, and most of it just feels subpar or doesn't click with me. I have this deep craving to discover new music, but my current methods (random playlists, album diving, etc.) feel useless.\n\nI'd also love to explore classical music, but I have no clue where to even begin with that.\n\nWhat I wish existed is a kind of mixtape - something curated, where I could pick out the songs I connect with without drowning in endless albums.\n\nSo... how do you all approach exploring new genres? Are there playlists, communities, or methods you use that don't feel so overwhelming?\n\nAny suggestions for specific songs, albums, or even strategies would be super appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!. Sorry in advance for the length of this. Jump to the third paragraph below for specific suggestions based on  bands you listed (e.g., Of Monsters and Men, Arctic Monkeys):\n\nI had this problem too. The way I overcame it was to pay attention to what was drawing me in the songs I did like and give that quality a name. This helped me recognize it in a more conscious way so that it could become something I could listen for. Once I did this, it became much easier for me to detect this quality when I scanned through new music.\n\nHere's an example: [Nimble](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/72IFsjh0fDGX39uLocWyWr?si=d59b94e6f42a4313). This is a sprightly, light-footed quality in music. In terms of timbre and rhythm, it is like a fairy--fast, light, fluttery, delicate. For some reason this is a quality I'm drawn to in music, but it doesn't already exist as a genre, so I had to discover it for myself. I did this by adding any song that gave me this feeling to a playlist. It started with 1 song (the first in the playlist), and has now built up to 27. Over time, the essential quality uniting these songs became more apparent, and I came to realize \"this is something I really like.\" I'm really good at spotting it now when listening to new music, and its led me into genres I didn't used to listen to, like hyper-pop.\n\nSo going off of what you said above, you're already doing something like that with Of Monsters and Men. You gave it the name \"whimsical folk-ish.\" I'm guessing there's a quality you recognize in their music, that you are giving that name to. I might create a playlist like that: \"Whimsical Folkish.\" Can you think of an image that captures this same quality? Make that the cover image--the cover will help you sustain focus on the quality. I actually look at my playlist covers when I listen to them because they help me recognize the quality each playlist is built around.\n\nThen write a blurb that captures whatever it is that draws you to this whimsical folkish type sound. Like the picture, this helps you sustain focus on this quality. In a sense, this \"genre\" of music doesn't fully exist yet--it's in a kind of fledgling state, so anything that helps you sustain focus on this nebulous quality is good.\n\nThen I would go to [Discover Quickly](https://discoverquickly.com/) and start exploring.

Sorry in advance for the length of this. Jump to the third paragraph below for specific suggestions based on  bands you listed (e.g., Of Monsters and Men, Arctic Monkeys):\n\nI had this problem too. The way I overcame it was to pay attention to what was drawing me in the songs I did like and give that quality a name. This helped me recognize it in a more conscious way so that it could become something I could listen for. Once I did this, it became much easier for me to detect this quality when I scanned through new music.\n\nHere's an example: [Nimble](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/72IFsjh0fDGX39uLocWyWr?si=d59b94e6f42a4313). This is a sprightly, light-footed quality in music. In terms of timbre and rhythm, it is like a fairy--fast, light, fluttery, delicate. For some reason this is a quality I'm drawn to in music, but it doesn't already exist as a genre, so I had to discover it for myself. I did this by adding any song that gave me this feeling to a playlist. It started with 1 song (the first in the playlist), and has now built up to 27. Over time, the essential quality uniting these songs became more apparent, and I came to realize \"this is something I really like.\" I'm really good at spotting it now when listening to new music, and its led me into genres I didn't used to listen to, like hyper-pop.\n\nSo going off of what you said above, you're already doing something like that with Of Monsters and Men. You gave it the name \"whimsical folk-ish.\" I'm guessing there's a quality you recognize in their music, that you are giving that name to. I might create a playlist like that: \"Whimsical Folkish.\" Can you think of an image that captures this same quality? Make that the cover image--the cover will help you sustain focus on the quality. I actually look at my playlist covers when I listen to them because they help me recognize the quality each playlist is built around.\n\nThen write a blurb that captures whatever it is that draws you to this whimsical folkish type sound. Like the picture, this helps you sustain focus on this quality. In a sense, this \"genre\" of music doesn't fully exist yet--it's in a kind of fledgling state, so anything that helps you sustain focus on this nebulous quality is good.\n\nThen I would go to [Discover Quickly](https://discoverquickly.com/) and start exploring. Here's one strategy: type \"Of Monsters and Men\" into the search bar. Click on their name and once you get to their page on the site, click \"recommended songs based on Of Monsters and Men.\" This will give you a bunch of songs to explore. Mouse over them to listen to snippets of each song. See if anything in the 30-second snippet gives you that \"whimsical folkish\" feeling. If so, add it to the playlist for deeper listening later.\n\nYou could do something similar with the Arctic Monkeys song. What is it you like about that song in particular? Can you recognize the quality you're responding to? Give it a name and build a playlist for it with just that one song in it. Then go to Discover Quickly, search for that song and when you find it, click \"recommended songs based on this.\" Start scanning through them, adding any song that gives you a similar feeling to the playlist. If none of the songs offered give you that feeling, click the refresh button (curved arrow above top row of songs offered) to get more.\n\nYou're building out from what you already like, further differentiating it and using it as a bridge into new music . This helped me expand my taste from indie-rock into pop, country, hip-hop and r&b. If you look at my [playlist library](https://open.spotify.com/user/apeiron101?si=ac4fe90ff27946d2), all but the first and last one are build around a specific quality in the way I'm describing. Through doing this, my musical taste has expanded dramatically in a few years. A lot of the qualities that you discover you respond to will cross existing genres and serve as gateways for you into these new musical worlds.",

It's just a hard thing for me to do.\n\nThe first time I really remember having a lot of trouble with the separation is with BØRNS, who if you don't know,('alledgedly') gr0omed, r@ped, and potentially drugged minors. \n\nI've always found his music absolutely fantastic but when I heard it made me sick. I continued to listen, thinking that it was beautiful art that could be appreciated without praising the artist.\n\nWhen the Suddenly EP came out, I was in love. It was so good and I found such comfort in it and even related to some of the lyrics. The only problem was that it was directly about how he felt after being shunned from society (for good reason btw).\n\nI listened to it for months but every time I sat down and listened I felt worse. Eventually I sat down, unhearted every song of his own Spotify, and removed him from all of my playlists. I couldn't do it, I was directly contributing to his whining about people not liking him after he abused minors.\n\nI've also done this for other artists but only for specific albums that directly talk about their bad deeds, think 'Eternal Sunshine' by Ariana Grande. I still have not listened to any of those songs.\n\nI hate to do it, but to quote AJR, \"I truly love the art when I kinda hate the artist\" I find this very true but sometimes I can't bring myself to support it.\n\nAnyone else feel this way?. You can't separate the two, the art IS the artist. It's an extension of themselves.\n\n\nMiles Davis was a drug addict, a deadbeat dad, a former pimp, a wife beater, and just overall a very dark personality. But he also had goodness in his heart, which he expressed through the beautiful music he created. Both sides of Miles Davis existed and were real.\n\n\nYou have to learn to take the good with the bad. By ignoring the good, you don't eliminate the bad, you just cut yourself off from the good. ",

      "full_context": "Your Top 4 Artists. Enough with Letterboxd and everyone’s top 4 movies; let’s discuss our top 4 Artists/Bands.\n\nList your top 4 Artists but for each state their general genre(s), a brief statement why they’re a fav of yours, your favorite album/EP and/or song by them, and a song/album that you would recommend to someone isn’t into or doesn’t know the artist.\n\nMy Top 4:\n\n1. Lady Gaga (Pop, Dance-pop). Her versatility is a force to be reckoned with; she’s gotten me to listen to and enjoy genres I normally wouldn’t be into or check out. She’s the total package; strong lyricist/songwriter, great producing ability, an amazing vocalist, trained musician, a skilled dancer, a refreshing and hypnotic persona and sense of style. And no one can do a music video like she does. If her artistry and music wasn’t enough, her strive and what she stands for make her iconic as well.\n\nFavorite Album = Born This Way, ARTPOP is close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Abracadabra, shows off the theatricality, strength, and versatility of her voice while exuding the weird and catchy lyricism that is part of her niche. And the production is immaculate and classic dance/synth Gaga.\n\nRecommended Album = ARTPOP or Mayhem, both are quintessential Gaga and have something for everybody on them.\n\n2. Young the Giant (Indie/Alternative Pop/Rock). They literally can’t make a bad song. The lead singer has the voice of an angel and it’s unique. Their melodies, production, and lyrics are a mood and matched with Sameer’s heavenly vocals, they entrance you. And with a signature style/sound all their albums sound different and have different sonic elements and themes.\n\nFavorite Album = Home of the Strange, Mirror Master is a close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Call Me Back, shows off Sameer’s vocals and exemplifies their sound/style and lyrical content.\n\nRecommended Album = Home of the Strange, a perfect showcase of their sound, their lyrical themes, and Sameer’s vocals. Has many of their best songs and music videos.\n\n3. Kid Cudi (Alternative Hip-hop, Melodic Rap). His music has great and addictive atmosphere and he really knows how to create a wonderful vibe through melodic beats, introspective and cosmic/spiritual lyrics, and his unique and eclectic vocal stylings and performance. He’s in a league of his own and that has made he so influential and so resonating.\n\nFavorite Album = Man On the Moon III: The Chosen\n\nRecommended Song = Just What I Am, the hypnotic and atmospheric melody and production he is known for, paired with his central lyrical themes and signature vocals/flow.\n\nRecommended Album = Man on the Moon series (1, 2, or 3), the trilogy best represents him and has most of his best and iconic work.\n\n4. Majid Jordan (Alternative R&B, Synthwave/pop). They make magic together. Deep bouncy and raving production, serenading soulful and emotional vocals, and decadent romantic lyrics; they’re a perfect R&B duo. They move me with their music in multiple ways lol.\n\nFavorite Album = Wildest Dreams\n\nRecommended Song = Something About You, classic Majid Jordan. Emotive and strong vocals from Majid, minimalistic but enchanting production from Jordan, and their signature affectionate lyrics. \n\nRecommended Album = A Place Like This - EP or Wildest Dreams, both are essential Majid Jordan and prominent work in their discography.. Michael Jackson \n- I’ve listened to Michael Jackson ever since I could hear rhythm and has been my foundation for finding out what I like \n- Bad or Dangerous can’t choose \n- I’d recommend Bad. Has the most hits and is very diverse.\n\nPrince\n- I started to listen to Prince about a year ago and now know a lot of his music. He has helped me embrace who I am and has such a unique sound\n- Purple Rain, Sign o The Times is close\n- Again I would recommend Purple Rain. The title track is imo the greatest song of all time every song is a hit. \n\nMetallica\n- Bit of a weird one according to my top 2 but I love them. Started listening to them about a year and a half ish years ago. They were introduction into harsh rock and metal. I love their guitar and got me into playing guitar myself.\n- …and Justice for All is my fav\n- If you are looking for something faster, more thrash, high screaming vocals I’d recommend ride the lightning or master of puppets. If you want heavier, slower or melodic and heavier/deeper vocals then the black album without a doubt\n\nThese are the only artists and bands I adore or just really know a lot about so just three ig 😂",

Emotive and strong vocals from Majid, minimalistic but enchanting production from Jordan, and their signature affectionate lyrics. \n\nRecommended Album = A Place Like This - EP or Wildest Dreams, both are essential Majid Jordan and prominent work in their discography.. 1. Car Seat Headrest (indie rock, slacker rock)\n\nFavorite album (and my favorite album of all time): How To Leave Town, I just think it's their most ambitious and relatable project\n\nRecommended album: Twin Fantasy (Face to Face), most CSH fans who got into the band after 2018 started with this album, most people consider it their magnum opus, the songwriting is extremely personal and heartbreaking at times (especially on the last 3 songs), if someone wants to check out 1 song I recommend Beach Life-In-Death, it's just iconic\n\n2. Swans (post-rock, experimental rock)\n\nFavorite album: To Be Kind, it's their most consistent album front to back, every song is an experience on its own and together they make something unforgettable, whether you like this album or not, I doubt it'll leave you indifferent\n\nRecommended album: White Light from the Mouth of Infinity, it's one of their most accessible works but still one of their strongest, I think Blind is one of the most beautifully written songs in their discography so I would start with that song\n\n3. Weatherday (noise pop, emo)\n\nFavorite album: both of them, Hornet Disaster and Come In are equally fantastic, great riffs, passionate performances, interesting songwriting and it's all noisy and I love when music is noisy\n\nRecommended album: Come In, purely because it's the first one and it's shorter, My Sputnik Sweetheart is a song I'd recommend from this album, it's a 12 minute emotional rollecoaster and it basically has everything Weatherday offers\n\n4. AJJ (folk punk, indie rock)\n\nFavorite album: Knife Man, it's a little messy but it's filled with fun and memorable songs that will make you laugh at how fucked we are, plus Big Bird is such a beautiful song, it's very different from their other songs but it's a perfect closer for an album like Knife Man\n\nRecommended album: People Who Eat People Are The Luckiest People In The World, this album is the perfect representation of AJJ's sound, it's probably their most cohesive record and has their best songwriting",

Car Seat Headrest (indie rock, slacker rock)\n\nFavorite album (and my favorite album of all time): How To Leave Town, I just think it's their most ambitious and relatable project\n\nRecommended album: Twin Fantasy (Face to Face), most CSH fans who got into the band after 2018 started with this album"

      "full_context": "Your Top 4 Artists. Enough with Letterboxd and everyone’s top 4 movies; let’s discuss our top 4 Artists/Bands.\n\nList your top 4 Artists but for each state their general genre(s), a brief statement why they’re a fav of yours, your favorite album/EP and/or song by them, and a song/album that you would recommend to someone isn’t into or doesn’t know the artist.\n\nMy Top 4:\n\n1. Lady Gaga (Pop, Dance-pop). Her versatility is a force to be reckoned with; she’s gotten me to listen to and enjoy genres I normally wouldn’t be into or check out. She’s the total package; strong lyricist/songwriter, great producing ability, an amazing vocalist, trained musician, a skilled dancer, a refreshing and hypnotic persona and sense of style. And no one can do a music video like she does. If her artistry and music wasn’t enough, her strive and what she stands for make her iconic as well.\n\nFavorite Album = Born This Way, ARTPOP is close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Abracadabra, shows off the theatricality, strength, and versatility of her voice while exuding the weird and catchy lyricism that is part of her niche. And the production is immaculate and classic dance/synth Gaga.\n\nRecommended Album = ARTPOP or Mayhem, both are quintessential Gaga and have something for everybody on them.\n\n2. Young the Giant (Indie/Alternative Pop/Rock). They literally can’t make a bad song. The lead singer has the voice of an angel and it’s unique. Their melodies, production, and lyrics are a mood and matched with Sameer’s heavenly vocals, they entrance you. And with a signature style/sound all their albums sound different and have different sonic elements and themes.\n\nFavorite Album = Home of the Strange, Mirror Master is a close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Call Me Back, shows off Sameer’s vocals and exemplifies their sound/style and lyrical content.\n\nRecommended Album = Home of the Strange, a perfect showcase of their sound, their lyrical themes, and Sameer’s vocals. Has many of their best songs and music videos.\n\n3. Kid Cudi (Alternative Hip-hop, Melodic Rap). His music has great and addictive atmosphere and he really knows how to create a wonderful vibe through melodic beats, introspective and cosmic/spiritual lyrics, and his unique and eclectic vocal stylings and performance. He’s in a league of his own and that has made he so influential and so resonating.\n\nFavorite Album = Man On the Moon III: The Chosen\n\nRecommended Song = Just What I Am, the hypnotic and atmospheric melody and production he is known for, paired with his central lyrical themes and signature vocals/flow.\n\nRecommended Album = Man on the Moon series (1, 2, or 3), the trilogy best represents him and has most of his best and iconic work.\n\n4. Majid Jordan (Alternative R&B, Synthwave/pop). They make magic together. Deep bouncy and raving production, serenading soulful and emotional vocals, and decadent romantic lyrics; they’re a perfect R&B duo. They move me with their music in multiple ways lol.\n\nFavorite Album = Wildest Dreams\n\nRecommended Song = Something About You, classic Majid Jordan. Emotive and strong vocals from Majid, minimalistic but enchanting production from Jordan, and their signature affectionate lyrics. \n\nRecommended Album = A Place Like This - EP or Wildest Dreams, both are essential Majid Jordan and prominent work in their discography.. This request is just right because I know exactly who my four favorites are in order, but once we get to #5 it's all muddled and I can never decide who should be where. So:\n\n1. Metric. An indie rock outfit from Canada. One reason I like them (aside from lead singer Emily Haines's voice and sharp lyrics) is that they don't repeat themselves; all of their albums are quite distinct from each other, even though they all have that essential \"Metric-ness\" I keep coming back for. My favorite album from them is *Pagans in Vegas*, although I get the impression from r/metricband that this is a minority opinion. (*Synthetica* seems to be much more of a favorite.) The Metric song that most people seem to have heard is \"Black Sheep\" (from *Scott Pilgrim*) but it is actually not that representative of their style overall. Some of my favorite songs from them include \"Celebrate\", \"Lie Lie Lie\", and \"The Governess\", all off *Pagans*, and none of which sound like each other; sampling from other albums, \"Gimme Sympathy\" (off *Fantasies*), \"Sick Muse\" (also *Fantasies*), \"On the Sly\" (*Grow Up and Blow Away*), and \"Risk\" (*Art of Doubt)* are all worth listening to, and the first four tracks of *Synthetica* (\"Artificial Nocturne\", \"Youth Without Youth\", \"Speed the Collapse\", and \"Breathing Underwater\") is one of the strongest album opener runs I've ever heard.\n2. The Joy Formidable. A trio from Wales. Also indie rock, but more guitar-oriented than Metric. The three of them and tiny lead singer/guitarist Ritzy Bryan are able to generate a lot of noise from a guitar, a bass, and drums. My favorite album from them (and current overall favorite album) is *Hitch*. Their song \"Liana\" is a good example of how they can go from soft to really loud over the course of one song.\n3. The Birthday Massacre, a Canadian goth/darkwave band. Think lots of synths and heavy guitars with electronic beats and mostly pretty vocals from lead singer Chibi, with occasional growling. My favorite album from them is still *Hide and Seek*, the one that introduced me to them, with \"Leaving Tonight\" and \"Down\" (with the aforementioned growling) being favorite tracks from it.\n4. Texas, a (despite the name) Scottish rock band. I would say they are indie rock too but they are more straightforwardly pop/rock than the others. My favorite album from them is probably *White on Blonde* which has many standout tracks, including \"Black-Eyed Boy\"; I can still remember hearing \"Black-Eyed Boy\" come up on the old [Last.fm](http://Last.fm) \"Neighbor Radio\" feature and being like, \"Who is *this*?\"",

Young the Giant (Indie/Alternative Pop/Rock). They literally can’t make a bad song. The lead singer has the voice of an angel and it’s unique. Their melodies, production, and lyrics are a mood and matched with Sameer’s heavenly vocals, they entrance you. And with a signature style/sound all their albums sound different and have different sonic elements and themes.\n\nFavorite Album = Home of the Strange, Mirror Master is a close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Call Me Back, shows off Sameer’s vocals and exemplifies their sound/style and lyrical content.\n\nRecommended Album = Home of the Strange, a perfect showcase of their sound, their lyrical themes, and Sameer’s vocals. Has many of their best songs and music videos.\n\n3. Kid Cudi (Alternative Hip-hop, Melodic Rap). His music has great and addictive atmosphere and he really knows how to create a wonderful vibe through melodic beats, introspective and cosmic/spiritual lyrics, and his unique and eclectic vocal stylings and performance. He’s in a league of his own and that has made he so influential and so resonating.\n\nFavorite Album = Man On the Moon III: The Chosen\n\nRecommended Song = Just What I Am, the hypnotic and atmospheric melody and production he is known for, paired with his central lyrical themes and signature vocals/flow.\n\nRecommended Album = Man on the Moon series (1, 2, or 3), the trilogy best represents him and has most of his best and iconic work.\n\n4. Majid Jordan (Alternative R&B, Synthwave/pop). They make magic together. Deep bouncy and raving production, serenading soulful and emotional vocals, and decadent romantic lyrics; they’re a perfect R&B duo. They move me with their music in multiple ways lol.\n\nFavorite Album = Wildest Dreams\n\nRecommended Song = Something About You, classic Majid Jordan. Emotive and strong vocals from Majid, minimalistic but enchanting production from Jordan, and their signature affectionate lyrics. \n\nRecommended Album = A Place Like This - EP or Wildest Dreams, both are essential Majid Jordan and prominent work in their discography.. This request is just right because I know exactly who my four favorites are in order, but once we get to #5 it's all muddled and I can never decide who should be where. So:\n\n1. Metric. An indie rock outfit from Canada. One reason I like them (aside from lead singer Emily Haines's voice and sharp lyrics) is that they don't repeat themselves; all of their albums are quite distinct from each other, even though they all have that essential \"Metric-ness\" I keep coming back for. My favorite album from them is *Pagans in Vegas*, although I get the impression from r/metricband that this is a minority opinion. (*Synthetica* seems to be much more of a favorite.) The Metric song that most people seem to have heard is \"Black Sheep\" (from *Scott Pilgrim*) but it is actually not that representative of their style overall. Some of my favorite songs from them include \"Celebrate\", \"Lie Lie Lie\", and \"The Governess\", all off *Pagans*, and none of which sound like each other; sampling from other albums, \"Gimme Sympathy\" (off *Fantasies*), \"Sick Muse\" (also *Fantasies*), \"On the Sly\" (*Grow Up and Blow Away*), and \"Risk\" (*Art of Doubt)* are all worth listening to, and the first four tracks of *Synthetica* (\"Artificial Nocturne\", \"Youth Without Youth\", \"Speed the Collapse\", and \"Breathing Underwater\") is one of the strongest album opener runs I've ever heard.\n2. The Joy Formidable. A trio from Wales. Also indie rock, but more guitar-oriented than Metric. The three of them and tiny lead singer/guitarist Ritzy Bryan are able to generate a lot of noise from a guitar, a bass, and drums. My favorite album from them (and current overall favorite album) is *Hitch*. Their song \"Liana\" is a good example of how they can go from soft to really loud over the course of one song.\n3. The Birthday Massacre, a Canadian goth/darkwave band. Think lots of synths and heavy guitars with electronic beats and mostly pretty vocals from lead singer Chibi, with occasional growling. My favorite album from them is still *Hide and Seek*, the one that introduced me to them, with \"Leaving Tonight\" and \"Down\" (with the aforementioned growling) being favorite tracks from it.\n4. Texas, a (despite the name) Scottish rock band. I would say they are indie rock too but they are more straightforwardly pop/rock than the others. My favorite album from them is probably *White on Blonde* which has many standout tracks, including \"Black-Eyed Boy\"; I can still remember hearing \"Black-Eyed Boy\" come up on the old [Last.fm](http://Last.fm) \"Neighbor Radio\" feature and being like, \"Who is *this*?\"",

My favorite album from them (and current overall favorite album) is *Hitch*. Their song \"Liana\" is a good example of how they can go from soft to really loud over the course of one song.\n3. The Birthday Massacre, a Canadian goth/darkwave band. Think lots of synths and heavy guitars with electronic beats and mostly pretty vocals from lead singer Chibi, with occasional growling. My favorite album from them is still *Hide and Seek*, the one that introduced me to them, with \"Leaving Tonight\" and \"Down\" (with the aforementioned growling) being favorite tracks from it.\n4. Texas, a (despite the name) Scottish rock band. I would say they are indie rock too but they are more straightforwardly pop/rock than the others. My favorite album from them is probably *White on Blonde* which has many standout tracks, including \"Black-Eyed Boy\"; I can still remember hearing \"Black-Eyed Boy\" come up on the old [Last.fm](http://Last.fm) \"Neighbor Radio\" feature and being like, \"Who is *this*?\"",

      "full_context": "Your Top 4 Artists. Enough with Letterboxd and everyone’s top 4 movies; let’s discuss our top 4 Artists/Bands.\n\nList your top 4 Artists but for each state their general genre(s), a brief statement why they’re a fav of yours, your favorite album/EP and/or song by them, and a song/album that you would recommend to someone isn’t into or doesn’t know the artist.\n\nMy Top 4:\n\n1. Lady Gaga (Pop, Dance-pop). Her versatility is a force to be reckoned with; she’s gotten me to listen to and enjoy genres I normally wouldn’t be into or check out. She’s the total package; strong lyricist/songwriter, great producing ability, an amazing vocalist, trained musician, a skilled dancer, a refreshing and hypnotic persona and sense of style. And no one can do a music video like she does. If her artistry and music wasn’t enough, her strive and what she stands for make her iconic as well.\n\nFavorite Album = Born This Way, ARTPOP is close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Abracadabra, shows off the theatricality, strength, and versatility of her voice while exuding the weird and catchy lyricism that is part of her niche. And the production is immaculate and classic dance/synth Gaga.\n\nRecommended Album = ARTPOP or Mayhem, both are quintessential Gaga and have something for everybody on them.\n\n2. Young the Giant (Indie/Alternative Pop/Rock). They literally can’t make a bad song. The lead singer has the voice of an angel and it’s unique. Their melodies, production, and lyrics are a mood and matched with Sameer’s heavenly vocals, they entrance you. And with a signature style/sound all their albums sound different and have different sonic elements and themes.\n\nFavorite Album = Home of the Strange, Mirror Master is a close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Call Me Back, shows off Sameer’s vocals and exemplifies their sound/style and lyrical content.\n\nRecommended Album = Home of the Strange, a perfect showcase of their sound, their lyrical themes, and Sameer’s vocals. Has many of their best songs and music videos.\n\n3. Kid Cudi (Alternative Hip-hop, Melodic Rap). His music has great and addictive atmosphere and he really knows how to create a wonderful vibe through melodic beats, introspective and cosmic/spiritual lyrics, and his unique and eclectic vocal stylings and performance. He’s in a league of his own and that has made he so influential and so resonating.\n\nFavorite Album = Man On the Moon III: The Chosen\n\nRecommended Song = Just What I Am, the hypnotic and atmospheric melody and production he is known for, paired with his central lyrical themes and signature vocals/flow.\n\nRecommended Album = Man on the Moon series (1, 2, or 3), the trilogy best represents him and has most of his best and iconic work.\n\n4. Majid Jordan (Alternative R&B, Synthwave/pop). They make magic together. Deep bouncy and raving production, serenading soulful and emotional vocals, and decadent romantic lyrics; they’re a perfect R&B duo. They move me with their music in multiple ways lol.\n\nFavorite Album = Wildest Dreams\n\nRecommended Song = Something About You, classic Majid Jordan. Emotive and strong vocals from Majid, minimalistic but enchanting production from Jordan, and their signature affectionate lyrics. \n\nRecommended Album = A Place Like This - EP or Wildest Dreams, both are essential Majid Jordan and prominent work in their discography.. This request is just right because I know exactly who my four favorites are in order, but once we get to #5 it's all muddled and I can never decide who should be where. So:\n\n1. Metric. An indie rock outfit from Canada. One reason I like them (aside from lead singer Emily Haines's voice and sharp lyrics) is that they don't repeat themselves; all of their albums are quite distinct from each other, even though they all have that essential \"Metric-ness\" I keep coming back for. My favorite album from them is *Pagans in Vegas*, although I get the impression from r/metricband that this is a minority opinion. (*Synthetica* seems to be much more of a favorite.) The Metric song that most people seem to have heard is \"Black Sheep\" (from *Scott Pilgrim*) but it is actually not that representative of their style overall. Some of my favorite songs from them include \"Celebrate\", \"Lie Lie Lie\", and \"The Governess\", all off *Pagans*, and none of which sound like each other; sampling from other albums, \"Gimme Sympathy\" (off *Fantasies*), \"Sick Muse\" (also *Fantasies*), \"On the Sly\" (*Grow Up and Blow Away*), and \"Risk\" (*Art of Doubt)* are all worth listening to, and the first four tracks of *Synthetica* (\"Artificial Nocturne\", \"Youth Without Youth\", \"Speed the Collapse\", and \"Breathing Underwater\") is one of the strongest album opener runs I've ever heard.\n2. The Joy Formidable. A trio from Wales. Also indie rock, but more guitar-oriented than Metric.

And with a signature style/sound all their albums sound different and have different sonic elements and themes.\n\nFavorite Album = Home of the Strange, Mirror Master is a close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Call Me Back, shows off Sameer’s vocals and exemplifies their sound/style and lyrical content.\n\nRecommended Album = Home of the Strange, a perfect showcase of their sound, their lyrical themes, and Sameer’s vocals. Has many of their best songs and music videos.\n\n3. Kid Cudi (Alternative Hip-hop, Melodic Rap). His music has great and addictive atmosphere and he really knows how to create a wonderful vibe through melodic beats, introspective and cosmic/spiritual lyrics, and his unique and eclectic vocal stylings and performance. He’s in a league of his own and that has made he so influential and so resonating.\n\nFavorite Album = Man On the Moon III: The Chosen\n\nRecommended Song = Just What I Am, the hypnotic and atmospheric melody and production he is known for, paired with his central lyrical themes and signature vocals/flow.\n\nRecommended Album = Man on the Moon series (1, 2, or 3), the trilogy best represents him and has most of his best and iconic work.\n\n4. Majid Jordan (Alternative R&B, Synthwave/pop). They make magic together. Deep bouncy and raving production, serenading soulful and emotional vocals, and decadent romantic lyrics; they’re a perfect R&B duo. They move me with their music in multiple ways lol.\n\nFavorite Album = Wildest Dreams\n\nRecommended Song = Something About You, classic Majid Jordan. Emotive and strong vocals from Majid, minimalistic but enchanting production from Jordan, and their signature affectionate lyrics. \n\nRecommended Album = A Place Like This - EP or Wildest Dreams, both are essential Majid Jordan and prominent work in their discography.. This request is just right because I know exactly who my four favorites are in order, but once we get to #5 it's all muddled and I can never decide who should be where. So:\n\n1. Metric. An indie rock outfit from Canada. One reason I like them (aside from lead singer Emily Haines's voice and sharp lyrics) is that they don't repeat themselves; all of their albums are quite distinct from each other, even though they all have that essential \"Metric-ness\" I keep coming back for. My favorite album from them is *Pagans in Vegas*, although I get the impression from r/metricband that this is a minority opinion. (*Synthetica* seems to be much more of a favorite.) The Metric song that most people seem to have heard is \"Black Sheep\" (from *Scott Pilgrim*) but it is actually not that representative of their style overall. Some of my favorite songs from them include \"Celebrate\", \"Lie Lie Lie\", and \"The Governess\", all off *Pagans*, and none of which sound like each other; sampling from other albums, \"Gimme Sympathy\" (off *Fantasies*), \"Sick Muse\" (also *Fantasies*), \"On the Sly\" (*Grow Up and Blow Away*), and \"Risk\" (*Art of Doubt)* are all worth listening to, and the first four tracks of *Synthetica* (\"Artificial Nocturne\", \"Youth Without Youth\", \"Speed the Collapse\", and \"Breathing Underwater\") is one of the strongest album opener runs I've ever heard.\n2. The Joy Formidable. A trio from Wales. Also indie rock, but more guitar-oriented than Metric. The three of them and tiny lead singer/guitarist Ritzy Bryan are able to generate a lot of noise from a guitar, a bass, and drums. My favorite album from them (and current overall favorite album) is *Hitch*. Their song \"Liana\" is a good example of how they can go from soft to really loud over the course of one song.\n3. The Birthday Massacre, a Canadian goth/darkwave band. Think lots of synths and heavy guitars with electronic beats and mostly pretty vocals from lead singer Chibi, with occasional growling. My favorite album from them is still *Hide and Seek*, the one that introduced me to them, with \"Leaving Tonight\" and \"Down\" (with the aforementioned growling) being favorite tracks from it.\n4. Texas, a (despite the name) Scottish rock band. I would say they are indie rock too but they are more straightforwardly pop/rock than the others. My favorite album from them is probably *White on Blonde* which has many standout tracks, including \"Black-Eyed Boy\"; I can still remember hearing \"Black-Eyed Boy\" come up on the old [Last.fm](http://Last.fm) \"Neighbor Radio\" feature and being like, \"Who is *this*?\"",

Lady Gaga (Pop, Dance-pop). Her versatility is a force to be reckoned with; she’s gotten me to listen to and enjoy genres I normally wouldn’t be into or check out. She’s the total package; strong lyricist/songwriter, great producing ability, an amazing vocalist, trained musician, a skilled dancer, a refreshing and hypnotic persona and sense of style. And no one can do a music video like she does. If her artistry and music wasn’t enough, her strive and what she stands for make her iconic as well.\n\nFavorite Album = Born This Way, ARTPOP is close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Abracadabra, shows off the theatricality, strength, and versatility of her voice while exuding the weird and catchy lyricism that is part of her niche. And the production is immaculate and classic dance/synth Gaga.\n\nRecommended Album = ARTPOP or Mayhem, both are quintessential Gaga and have something for everybody on them.\n\n2.

Texas, a (despite the name) Scottish rock band. I would say they are indie rock too but they are more straightforwardly pop/rock than the others.

      "full_context": "Your Top 4 Artists. Enough with Letterboxd and everyone’s top 4 movies; let’s discuss our top 4 Artists/Bands.\n\nList your top 4 Artists but for each state their general genre(s), a brief statement why they’re a fav of yours, your favorite album/EP and/or song by them, and a song/album that you would recommend to someone isn’t into or doesn’t know the artist.\n\nMy Top 4:\n\n1. Lady Gaga (Pop, Dance-pop). Her versatility is a force to be reckoned with; she’s gotten me to listen to and enjoy genres I normally wouldn’t be into or check out. She’s the total package; strong lyricist/songwriter, great producing ability, an amazing vocalist, trained musician, a skilled dancer, a refreshing and hypnotic persona and sense of style. And no one can do a music video like she does. If her artistry and music wasn’t enough, her strive and what she stands for make her iconic as well.\n\nFavorite Album = Born This Way, ARTPOP is close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Abracadabra, shows off the theatricality, strength, and versatility of her voice while exuding the weird and catchy lyricism that is part of her niche. And the production is immaculate and classic dance/synth Gaga.\n\nRecommended Album = ARTPOP or Mayhem, both are quintessential Gaga and have something for everybody on them.\n\n2. Young the Giant (Indie/Alternative Pop/Rock). They literally can’t make a bad song. The lead singer has the voice of an angel and it’s unique. Their melodies, production, and lyrics are a mood and matched with Sameer’s heavenly vocals, they entrance you. And with a signature style/sound all their albums sound different and have different sonic elements and themes.\n\nFavorite Album = Home of the Strange, Mirror Master is a close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Call Me Back, shows off Sameer’s vocals and exemplifies their sound/style and lyrical content.\n\nRecommended Album = Home of the Strange, a perfect showcase of their sound, their lyrical themes, and Sameer’s vocals. Has many of their best songs and music videos.\n\n3. Kid Cudi (Alternative Hip-hop, Melodic Rap). His music has great and addictive atmosphere and he really knows how to create a wonderful vibe through melodic beats, introspective and cosmic/spiritual lyrics, and his unique and eclectic vocal stylings and performance. He’s in a league of his own and that has made he so influential and so resonating.\n\nFavorite Album = Man On the Moon III: The Chosen\n\nRecommended Song = Just What I Am, the hypnotic and atmospheric melody and production he is known for, paired with his central lyrical themes and signature vocals/flow.\n\nRecommended Album = Man on the Moon series (1, 2, or 3), the trilogy best represents him and has most of his best and iconic work.\n\n4. Majid Jordan (Alternative R&B, Synthwave/pop). They make magic together. Deep bouncy and raving production, serenading soulful and emotional vocals, and decadent romantic lyrics; they’re a perfect R&B duo. They move me with their music in multiple ways lol.\n\nFavorite Album = Wildest Dreams\n\nRecommended Song = Something About You, classic Majid Jordan. Emotive and strong vocals from Majid, minimalistic but enchanting production from Jordan, and their signature affectionate lyrics. \n\nRecommended Album = A Place Like This - EP or Wildest Dreams, both are essential Majid Jordan and prominent work in their discography.. This request is just right because I know exactly who my four favorites are in order, but once we get to #5 it's all muddled and I can never decide who should be where. So:\n\n1. Metric. An indie rock outfit from Canada. One reason I like them (aside from lead singer Emily Haines's voice and sharp lyrics) is that they don't repeat themselves; all of their albums are quite distinct from each other, even though they all have that essential \"Metric-ness\" I keep coming back for. My favorite album from them is *Pagans in Vegas*, although I get the impression from r/metricband that this is a minority opinion. (*Synthetica* seems to be much more of a favorite.) The Metric song that most people seem to have heard is \"Black Sheep\" (from *Scott Pilgrim*) but it is actually not that representative of their style overall. Some of my favorite songs from them include \"Celebrate\", \"Lie Lie Lie\", and \"The Governess\", all off *Pagans*, and none of which sound like each other; sampling from other albums, \"Gimme Sympathy\" (off *Fantasies*), \"Sick Muse\" (also *Fantasies*), \"On the Sly\" (*Grow Up and Blow Away*), and \"Risk\" (*Art of Doubt)* are all worth listening to, and the first four tracks of *Synthetica* (\"Artificial Nocturne\", \"Youth Without Youth\", \"Speed the Collapse\", and \"Breathing Underwater\") is one of the strongest album opener runs I've ever heard.\n2. The Joy Formidable. A trio from Wales. Also indie rock, but more guitar-oriented than Metric. The three of them and tiny lead singer/guitarist Ritzy Bryan are able to generate a lot of noise from a guitar, a bass, and drums. My favorite album from them (and current overall favorite album) is *Hitch*. Their song \"Liana\" is a good example of how they can go from soft to really loud over the course of one song.\n3. The Birthday Massacre, a Canadian goth/darkwave band. Think lots of synths and heavy guitars with electronic beats and mostly pretty vocals from lead singer Chibi, with occasional growling. My favorite album from them is still *Hide and Seek*, the one that introduced me to them, with \"Leaving Tonight\" and \"Down\" (with the aforementioned growling) being favorite tracks from it.\n4. Texas, a (despite the name) Scottish rock band. I would say they are indie rock too but they are more straightforwardly pop/rock than the others.

They move me with their music in multiple ways lol.\n\nFavorite Album = Wildest Dreams\n\nRecommended Song = Something About You, classic Majid Jordan. Emotive and strong vocals from Majid, minimalistic but enchanting production from Jordan, and their signature affectionate lyrics. \n\nRecommended Album = A Place Like This - EP or Wildest Dreams, both are essential Majid Jordan and prominent work in their discography.. 1. Mike Oldfield (Progressive rock, synth-pop, new age, Celtic trad/world) - IMO one of the most talented composers alive. While some of his work is less than inspiring his heights are some of the greatest tracks music has to offer. Among his more accessible offerings is some extremely finely crafted pop/rock, folk, new age and traditional with healthy doses of creative progressive sensibilities, while the epics he's perhaps most loved for are utterly beautiful, they're pure musical prowess and leave nearly no ground untreaded. In my opinion they should be studied by music students for decades.\n\nFavourite Album: *Ommadawn*. I do think this may genuinely be one of the greatest pieces of music ever composed. Incredibly powerful and emotional with rich, lush layers of instrumentations, and a symphonic structure that takes you on a complete journey. The little folk tune at the end, *On Horseback*, is a surprisingly perfect capstone for such an intense album.\n\nRecommended Song: *Tubular Bells Part 1*. It's his best selling and most famous piece for a reason, even if I don't think it's his best. A good introduction to what he's all about.\n\nRecommended Album: *Crises*. Contains bits and pieces of most of the main ground he covered musically and the B side is all fairly short and accessible songs which makes it a good starting place for people who may find his epics intimidating at first- although it also has one of those for people who want to give it a go.\n\n2. King Crimson (Progressive rock, jazz fusion, jazz, new wave, heavy metal, really just whatever the hell Fripp could rope a few guys into doing that year) - An eclectic and prolific band led by guitar genius Robert Fripp who are somewhat paradoxically both overlooked and incredibly influential. Their debut album *In The Court of the Crimson King* more or less kickstarted progressive rock and they were also a main influence on genres like math rock. King Crimson is far from a band for everyone, and even their fans will almost definitely have at least one album they hate thanks to their huge range of genres and past members, but it's have to deny that they've always been visionaries who through their many lineups were never afraid to release something weird, complex, and unconventional, even if it meant that they never quite managed to get past the status of \"big name in their subgenre\".\n\nFavourite Album: *Discipline*. The beginning of their '80s new-wave inspired era featuring a lineup of Robert Fripp (lead guitar), Adrian Belew (vocals & rhythm guitar), Tony Levin (bass, Chapman Stick & backing vocal), and Bill Bruford (drums and percussion). A consistently good album that hides some incredibly complex (not many guitarists out there have conquered the riff of *Frame by Frame*), original music behind an extremely fun zany exterior. A lot of artists, KC sometimes included, who go for something a little more out there run into an issue where at the same time as it becomes out there it becomes a bit miserable to listen to- *Discipline* completely avoids this issue.\n\nRecommended Song: *Starless.* A nice introduction to some of their wide range of influences and simply an excellently made song- some consider it their masterpiece. The first few minutes are actually a fairly standard structured song that's quite accessible but after that it pivots into an extremely tense build-up and climax that has always impressed me.\n\nRecommended Album: *In The Court of the Crimson King.* It's nearly impossible to recommend a one size fits all album for King Crimson simply because of how distinct (and sometimes polarising) each of their albums are, but their first album is where I would say most fans start and it's an all-round very solid album that covers a lot of ground.\n\n3. Peter Gabriel (Art pop, art rock, pop soul, progressive pop) - The original Genesis frontman turned pop icon, his music blends world, soul, prog and pop influences into something unique and amazing, and I personally find his voice lovely. Although he toned it down going into his solo pop career post-Genesis, he was at one point known for the elaborate costumes and in-character dancing and acting he would infuse into his performances, eventually culminating with the downright theatrical (although disastrous) *The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway* tour, something which made him stand out a lot in a time when the best that a live band usually did visually was fancy shirts and a painted bass drum head. Even past his UV-reactive makeup and fox masks era, though, he has always put some of that dramatic flair into his performances, something I really appreciate as a lover of all things over the top and creative.\n\nFavourite Album: *Peter Gabriel (aka Melt).* His third out of four self titled albums (because hey, who needs to tell them apart?) and some of the last remains of the prog rock he trailed into his solo career from Genesis with its influences from Robert Fripp. Dark-sounding, mildly experimental and rocky, and altogether very Peter Gabriel, especially considering overtly political tracks like *Biko* and *Games Without Frontiers.*\n\nRecommended Song: *Sledgehammer*. Just stupidly catchy and awesome, really- also MTV's most viewed music video, apparently, I recommend watching it because it's not without reason! \n\nRecommended Album: *So.* Full of great songs- serious, but with a playful charm at times. It's his first properly pop album with almost none of his old prog type stuff (in his own words, this is the new stuff!) but none the worse for it.",

Contains bits and pieces of most of the main ground he covered musically and the B side is all fairly short and accessible songs which makes it a good starting place for people who may find his epics intimidating at first- although it also has one of those for people who want to give it a go.\n\n2. King Crimson (Progressive rock, jazz fusion, jazz, new wave, heavy metal, really just whatever the hell Fripp could rope a few guys into doing that year) - An eclectic and prolific band led by guitar genius Robert Fripp who are somewhat paradoxically both overlooked and incredibly influential. Their debut album *In The Court of the Crimson King* more or less kickstarted progressive rock and they were also a main influence on genres like math rock. King Crimson is far from a band for everyone, and even their fans will almost definitely have at least one album they hate thanks to their huge range of genres and past members, but it's have to deny that they've always been visionaries who through their many lineups were never afraid to release something weird, complex, and unconventional, even if it meant that they never quite managed to get past the status of \"big name in their subgenre\".\n\nFavourite Album: *Discipline*. The beginning of their '80s new-wave inspired era featuring a lineup of Robert Fripp (lead guitar), Adrian Belew (vocals & rhythm guitar), Tony Levin (bass, Chapman Stick & backing vocal), and Bill Bruford (drums and percussion). A consistently good album that hides some incredibly complex (not many guitarists out there have conquered the riff of *Frame by Frame*), original music behind an extremely fun zany exterior. A lot of artists, KC sometimes included, who go for something a little more out there run into an issue where at the same time as it becomes out there it becomes a bit miserable to listen to- *Discipline* completely avoids this issue.\n\nRecommended Song: *Starless.* A nice introduction to some of their wide range of influences and simply an excellently made song- some consider it their masterpiece. The first few minutes are actually a fairly standard structured song that's quite accessible but after that it pivots into an extremely tense build-up and climax that has always impressed me.\n\nRecommended Album: *In The Court of the Crimson King.* It's nearly impossible to recommend a one size fits all album for King Crimson simply because of how distinct (and sometimes polarising) each of their albums are, but their first album is where I would say most fans start and it's an all-round very solid album that covers a lot of ground.\n\n3. Peter Gabriel (Art pop, art rock, pop soul, progressive pop) - The original Genesis frontman turned pop icon, his music blends world, soul, prog and pop influences into something unique and amazing, and I personally find his voice lovely. Although he toned it down going into his solo pop career post-Genesis, he was at one point known for the elaborate costumes and in-character dancing and acting he would infuse into his performances, eventually culminating with the downright theatrical (although disastrous) *The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway* tour, something which made him stand out a lot in a time when the best that a live band usually did visually was fancy shirts and a painted bass drum head. Even past his UV-reactive makeup and fox masks era, though, he has always put some of that dramatic flair into his performances, something I really appreciate as a lover of all things over the top and creative.\n\nFavourite Album: *Peter Gabriel (aka Melt).* His third out of four self titled albums (because hey, who needs to tell them apart?) and some of the last remains of the prog rock he trailed into his solo career from Genesis with its influences from Robert Fripp. Dark-sounding, mildly experimental and rocky, and altogether very Peter Gabriel, especially considering overtly political tracks like *Biko* and *Games Without Frontiers.*\n\nRecommended Song: *Sledgehammer*. Just stupidly catchy and awesome, really- also MTV's most viewed music video, apparently, I recommend watching it because it's not without reason! \n\nRecommended Album: *So.* Full of great songs- serious, but with a playful charm at times. It's his first properly pop album with almost none of his old prog type stuff (in his own words, this is the new stuff!) but none the worse for it.",

      "full_context": "Your Top 4 Artists. Enough with Letterboxd and everyone’s top 4 movies; let’s discuss our top 4 Artists/Bands.\n\nList your top 4 Artists but for each state their general genre(s), a brief statement why they’re a fav of yours, your favorite album/EP and/or song by them, and a song/album that you would recommend to someone isn’t into or doesn’t know the artist.\n\nMy Top 4:\n\n1. Lady Gaga (Pop, Dance-pop). Her versatility is a force to be reckoned with; she’s gotten me to listen to and enjoy genres I normally wouldn’t be into or check out. She’s the total package; strong lyricist/songwriter, great producing ability, an amazing vocalist, trained musician, a skilled dancer, a refreshing and hypnotic persona and sense of style. And no one can do a music video like she does. If her artistry and music wasn’t enough, her strive and what she stands for make her iconic as well.\n\nFavorite Album = Born This Way, ARTPOP is close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Abracadabra, shows off the theatricality, strength, and versatility of her voice while exuding the weird and catchy lyricism that is part of her niche. And the production is immaculate and classic dance/synth Gaga.\n\nRecommended Album = ARTPOP or Mayhem, both are quintessential Gaga and have something for everybody on them.\n\n2. Young the Giant (Indie/Alternative Pop/Rock). They literally can’t make a bad song. The lead singer has the voice of an angel and it’s unique. Their melodies, production, and lyrics are a mood and matched with Sameer’s heavenly vocals, they entrance you. And with a signature style/sound all their albums sound different and have different sonic elements and themes.\n\nFavorite Album = Home of the Strange, Mirror Master is a close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Call Me Back, shows off Sameer’s vocals and exemplifies their sound/style and lyrical content.\n\nRecommended Album = Home of the Strange, a perfect showcase of their sound, their lyrical themes, and Sameer’s vocals. Has many of their best songs and music videos.\n\n3. Kid Cudi (Alternative Hip-hop, Melodic Rap). His music has great and addictive atmosphere and he really knows how to create a wonderful vibe through melodic beats, introspective and cosmic/spiritual lyrics, and his unique and eclectic vocal stylings and performance. He’s in a league of his own and that has made he so influential and so resonating.\n\nFavorite Album = Man On the Moon III: The Chosen\n\nRecommended Song = Just What I Am, the hypnotic and atmospheric melody and production he is known for, paired with his central lyrical themes and signature vocals/flow.\n\nRecommended Album = Man on the Moon series (1, 2, or 3), the trilogy best represents him and has most of his best and iconic work.\n\n4. Majid Jordan (Alternative R&B, Synthwave/pop). They make magic together. Deep bouncy and raving production, serenading soulful and emotional vocals, and decadent romantic lyrics; they’re a perfect R&B duo. They move me with their music in multiple ways lol.\n\nFavorite Album = Wildest Dreams\n\nRecommended Song = Something About You, classic Majid Jordan. Emotive and strong vocals from Majid, minimalistic but enchanting production from Jordan, and their signature affectionate lyrics. \n\nRecommended Album = A Place Like This - EP or Wildest Dreams, both are essential Majid Jordan and prominent work in their discography.. 1. Mike Oldfield (Progressive rock, synth-pop, new age, Celtic trad/world) - IMO one of the most talented composers alive. While some of his work is less than inspiring his heights are some of the greatest tracks music has to offer. Among his more accessible offerings is some extremely finely crafted pop/rock, folk, new age and traditional with healthy doses of creative progressive sensibilities, while the epics he's perhaps most loved for are utterly beautiful, they're pure musical prowess and leave nearly no ground untreaded. In my opinion they should be studied by music students for decades.\n\nFavourite Album: *Ommadawn*. I do think this may genuinely be one of the greatest pieces of music ever composed. Incredibly powerful and emotional with rich, lush layers of instrumentations, and a symphonic structure that takes you on a complete journey. The little folk tune at the end, *On Horseback*, is a surprisingly perfect capstone for such an intense album.\n\nRecommended Song: *Tubular Bells Part 1*. It's his best selling and most famous piece for a reason, even if I don't think it's his best. A good introduction to what he's all about.\n\nRecommended Album: *Crises*. Contains bits and pieces of most of the main ground he covered musically and the B side is all fairly short and accessible songs which makes it a good starting place for people who may find his epics intimidating at first- although it also has one of those for people who want to give it a go.\n\n2.

      "full_context": "I need songs that describe the feeling of wanting someone other's say you shouldn't date or like. I have this huge crush on this one guy, and he's just so much more different than my usual crushes. I usually get this feeling of guilt or impending doom whenever i talk to guys in a talking stage or \"romantically\", but with this one guy, i don't. I like him so much (hes so sweet, kind, funny, and just overall amazing). but others say his past is bad and that dating him is a bad decision. Also, if i do end up dating him and i end up breaking up with him, i would have to leave a community that i love so much, and i don't want to risk losing that. I decided not to pursure him anymore based on my own terms but i can't help but still like him so much. i'm using music to get over him tbh...   \nhere's the songs i have in the playlist so far (please rec songs that are slow and more \"in the feels\" vibes)  \n1. just so you know - jesse mccartney  \n2. sparks - coldplay  \n3. the scientist - coldplay  \n4.

      "full_context": "Do you like Country Music Yes or No and Why?. I like Country music Because The songs are simple. You only have to know four chords to be able to play most country songs on guitar. \n\nSome of the more difficult ones contain five chords throughout the entire song though.\n\nThe songs are short and sweet. Country songs will range between three and a half to four minutes in length so they cannot be considered boring or repetitive.\n\nCountry music is structured. Country has perfected a very strict structure. Nearly every song follows a certain pattern: intro, verse 1, chorus, verse 2, chorus, bridge/verse 3, solo/interlude, chorus (x2), outro.\n\nThe artists are selfless. Rather than write music that they enjoy, country artists write music based on what their fans want to hear.\n\n“Country singers always seem to be singing about something in their life that is relatable to our own lives. That makes me want to listen to their music,” said Maya Sheth\n\nThe songs are emotional. Country songs all have lyrics that display either happiness or sadness. \n\nThe lyrics are so powerful that when simply read out loud like a story they have the same meaning and emotion as when they are backed by instrumentation.\n\nThe songs are understandable. Because the lyrics are so literal, you do not have to think about what the song means when you listen to it. The artist tells you exactly what it is about, there are no confusing metaphors that make you think for yourself.\n\n“I always know what country singers are singing about because they have really good diction. Then I can enjoy the song and understand it!” said Mary Fry\n\nThe lyrics are meaningful stories. The lyrics to a country song manage to mix emotions, just as a story twists and turns, even while keeping the same tempo, chord progression, and instrumental theme underneath. \n\nAlso, the lyrics tell valuable life lessons, straying away from topics such as sex, alcohol, and money.\n\nThe musicians are very knowledgeable.  Country musicians are very proficient in 4/4 timing, 4 bar structure, and your basic major/minor scales.\n\nThe artists are very talented.  Most country singers don’t write any of the lyrics or instrumentation in their songs so they focus solely on singing, making them more talented than those who do everything\n\nCountry music is quickly becoming the most popular music genre in the US. Nearly a quarter of the American population now listens to country music, so why not follow the herd? Anything unique, original, dissonant, unorthodox, complex, technical, and creative is repulsive and overrated. \n\nIt’s Relatable\n\nIt has a Unique Sound\nEveryone knows that country music has a tone like no other. It’s full of big voices and lots of twang! But just because country singers have a distinct sound, it doesn’t mean they all sound the same. That’s what makes country music so great. You can tell when a country song is playing but you can also tell the difference between artists and the way they interpret the meaning of a country song. Take Carrie Underwood and Luke Bryan, for example. Both are prominent country singers, but you can hear the difference in their styles. This gives you so much more variety while still listening to an awesome genre!\n\nModern Hits Are As Good As The Classics\n\nLike all types of music, country has gone through some serious changes over the years. You might prefer the raw sound of the old-timers, or maybe you like the evolved crispness of the newer artists. \n\nBut, whether your favorite is Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, or Blake Shelton, most people agree that all the eras of country sound great.\n\nThe Artists Are Attractive\n\nAlthough the way a person looks should not affect their music or success, it’s still a plus when they are easy on the eyes! And I can assure you that these days country singers are easy on the eyes and the ears! Male artists that many women swoon over include Luke Bryan, Jordan Davis, Jason Aldean, Dan + Shay, and so many more! There are also some fierce country ladies like Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood, Lisa McHugh, and Kimberly Perry from The Band Perry. So not only can you enjoy some awesome music, but you can enjoy an awesome view at the same time!\n\nClean Lyrics\nAnother benefit of country music is that most of it is family-friendly. Other than the odd song, it very rarely has any bad words or other questionable lyrics, so you won’t find yourself covering the ears of any little cowboys or cowgirls who may be listening with you. It’s also a safe genre to sing along to in front of your grandparents!\n\nIt’s Loads Of Fun\nI often hear country music getting a bad rep because people say things like: “It all sounds the same” or “It isn’t as much fun as other genres.” But personally, I think any song that makes you want to get up and dance around is a lot of fun, and most country songs make me want to do just that. Country singers know how to have fun, and they want you to have fun dancing along with them. If you ever get the chance to go to a country concert, you’ll know exactly what I mean. There is so much singing and dancing that you can’t help but join in.\n\nIt Brings People Together\nWhether you’re young or old, single or parents of five, there are plenty of ways country music can bring you together as a social activity. Putting it on the speakers while hanging out at home is great, but going to a dance hall or live concert gives you a more active way to make use of your cowboy boots. There are songs that are perfect for romantic dates, and others that really liven up a family barbecue. \n\nCountry music is a great way to bring people together.\n\nCountry music can sometimes be left out or forgotten about because of music that tends to seem more modern or new. But country music reminds us of good old fashioned fun with a splash of some good morals thrown in, along with some good-looking artists and a sound that’s unlike anything else! There are so many more reasons to love country music but those were some of the best! Is there anything I missed?\n\n. I love country. You can fix your whole life by just playing it backwards.",

Country singers know how to have fun, and they want you to have fun dancing along with them. If you ever get the chance to go to a country concert, you’ll know exactly what I mean. There is so much singing and dancing that you can’t help but join in.\n\nIt Brings People Together\nWhether you’re young or old, single or parents of five, there are plenty of ways country music can bring you together as a social activity. Putting it on the speakers while hanging out at home is great, but going to a dance hall or live concert gives you a more active way to make use of your cowboy boots. There are songs that are perfect for romantic dates, and others that really liven up a family barbecue. \n\nCountry music is a great way to bring people together.\n\nCountry music can sometimes be left out or forgotten about because of music that tends to seem more modern or new. But country music reminds us of good old fashioned fun with a splash of some good morals thrown in, along with some good-looking artists and a sound that’s unlike anything else!

There is so much singing and dancing that you can’t help but join in.\n\nIt Brings People Together\nWhether you’re young or old, single or parents of five, there are plenty of ways country music can bring you together as a social activity. Putting it on the speakers while hanging out at home is great, but going to a dance hall or live concert gives you a more active way to make use of your cowboy boots. There are songs that are perfect for romantic dates, and others that really liven up a family barbecue. \n\nCountry music is a great way to bring people together.\n\nCountry music can sometimes be left out or forgotten about because of music that tends to seem more modern or new. But country music reminds us of good old fashioned fun with a splash of some good morals thrown in, along with some good-looking artists and a sound that’s unlike anything else!

You only have to know four chords to be able to play most country songs on guitar. \n\nSome of the more difficult ones contain five chords throughout the entire song though.\n\nThe songs are short and sweet. Country songs will range between three and a half to four minutes in length so they cannot be considered boring or repetitive.\n\nCountry music is structured.

That makes me want to listen to their music,” said Maya Sheth\n\nThe songs are emotional. Country songs all have lyrics that display either happiness or sadness. \n\nThe lyrics are so powerful that when simply read out loud like a story they have the same meaning and emotion as when they are backed by instrumentation.\n\nThe songs are understandable. Because the lyrics are so literal, you do not have to think about what the song means when you listen to it. The artist tells you exactly what it is about, there are no confusing metaphors that make you think for yourself.\n\n“I always know what country singers are singing about because they have really good diction.

It’s full of big voices and lots of twang! But just because country singers have a distinct sound, it doesn’t mean they all sound the same. That’s what makes country music so great. You can tell when a country song is playing but you can also tell the difference between artists and the way they interpret the meaning of a country song. Take Carrie Underwood and Luke Bryan, for example. Both are prominent country singers, but you can hear the difference in their styles. This gives you so much more variety while still listening to an awesome genre!\n\nModern Hits Are As Good As The Classics\n\nLike all types of music, country has gone through some serious changes over the years. You might prefer the raw sound of the old-timers, or maybe you like the evolved crispness of the newer artists. \n\nBut, whether your favorite is Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, or Blake Shelton, most people agree that all the eras of country sound great.\n\nThe Artists Are Attractive\n\nAlthough the way a person looks should not affect their music or success, it’s still a plus when they are easy on the eyes! And I can assure you that these days country singers are easy on the eyes and the ears! Male artists that many women swoon over include Luke Bryan, Jordan Davis, Jason Aldean, Dan + Shay, and so many more! There are also some fierce country ladies like Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood, Lisa McHugh, and Kimberly Perry from The Band Perry. So not only can you enjoy some awesome music, but you can enjoy an awesome view at the same time!\n\nClean Lyrics\nAnother benefit of country music is that most of it is family-friendly.
