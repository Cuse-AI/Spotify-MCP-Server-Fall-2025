The song “She used to be mine” by Sara Bareilles from the musical “Waitress” makes me cry every time. Literally sob. I’m talking fetal position/ ugly crying EVERY. SINGLE. TIME! I’ve listened to it alone, with my family, in public places, riding my bike, doing summersaults you name it! It doesn’t matter if I’m feeling mad, sad, happy as can be, fun and flirty and ready to party- you play that song and I’ll be a puddle of tears by the time she sings “She is lonely…” It’s this amazing phenomenon I’ve never experienced with any other piece of music in my entire life! Maybe it’s just Sara’s voice but I’m fascinated and wondering if any other song will ever elicit such intense emotion. \n\nSo.. what do you got?! Let’s try to recreate this with something different. Maybe more songs from musicals? Tv shows? Classical pieces perhaps? I don’t know I’m just so curious if this reaction can be replicated. It kinda cracks me up (once I stop crying of course) lol!.

The song “She used to be mine” by Sara Bareilles from the musical “Waitress” makes me cry every time. Literally sob. I’m talking fetal position/ ugly crying EVERY. SINGLE. TIME! I’ve listened to it alone, with my family, in public places, riding my bike, doing summersaults you name it! It doesn’t matter if I’m feeling mad, sad, happy as can be, fun and flirty and ready to party- you play that song and I’ll be a puddle of tears by the time she sings “She is lonely…” It’s this amazing phenomenon I’ve never experienced with any other piece of music in my entire life! Maybe it’s just Sara’s voice but I’m fascinated and wondering if any other song will ever elicit such intense emotion. \n\nSo.. what do you got?! Let’s try to recreate this with something different. Maybe more songs from musicals? Tv shows? Classical pieces perhaps? I don’t know I’m just so curious if this reaction can be replicated. It kinda cracks me up (once I stop crying of course) lol!.

It doesn’t matter if I’m feeling mad, sad, happy as can be, fun and flirty and ready to party- you play that song and I’ll be a puddle of tears by the time she sings “She is lonely…” It’s this amazing phenomenon I’ve never experienced with any other piece of music in my entire life! Maybe it’s just Sara’s voice but I’m fascinated and wondering if any other song will ever elicit such intense emotion. \n\nSo.. what do you got?! Let’s try to recreate this with something different. Maybe more songs from musicals? Tv shows? Classical pieces perhaps? I don’t know I’m just so curious if this reaction can be replicated. It kinda cracks me up (once I stop crying of course) lol!. For me it’s „sound the bugle“ by Bryan Adams from the Film Spirit. I know its a very emotional scene and Song but for some Reason I always have to cry. It can be the happiest day of my life but if you play this song I‘ll burst into tears. \n\nIn fact it’s the german version of this Song „spielt das Horn nochmal“ by Pur that really gets me but since most of you don’t know german I figured why not taking the english version.\n\nP.S. I‘m writing in tears because I listened to the first 30 seconds.",

It feels like FOBD but maybe after some years have passed\n\n- second the rec for Show me how to live and also Set it Off\n\n- **Red Hot Chili Peppers - Under the Bridge** you've probably heard it,but If you haven't it is the song that launched the band into fame.",

      "full_context": "Actually scary music?.  Let me start off by saying I love music. Its this magical, ancient thing that goes back before language and even sentience. It can tap into our brains and inject pure emotion. I'm sure you can think of plenty of songs that make you happy, sad, angry, hopeful, etc.\n\nI've been looking for music that's actually scary. I'm not sure what that entails, but I've been down rabbit holes all over the internet trying to find something that gives me goosebumps. \n\n I've been through Cradle of Filth, and though their music has plenty of creepy influences and storylines,  they're a little too \"look at me\" to be actually scary.\n \n\"Dance with the Devil\" by Immortal Technique is another one recommended to me. It's a graphic rap song about a kid who'll do anything to get in with the gangbangers, and at the end he does something so horrible, he can't stand himself.\n\n So far, the only song that actually made me uncomfortable to listen to was one from a long time ago, maybe mid 90's. Don't laugh, but it was from a Christian singer known as \"Carman\". The song was called \"God In America Again\".\n\n Before I go further, let me clarify I am not a Christian, nor am I particularly religious in any sense. However, the beginning of this song is simple:\n\nIt starts as a spoken word about the founding fathers, with a solemn sounding Gospel choir in the background, along with a sparse bass drum. At around 40 seconds, the drum beat changes into something that might resemble a horror movie right before the jump scare. He talks of how we shook off the chains of tyranny from britain, and declared our independence as a god-fearing Nation. He then goes on about how we've deviated from those Christian values and so we need \"God In America Again\". But the way he speaks about it makes it sound as if we had brought the apocalypse to light. \n\n At the end of the spoken word section, right before a melody is sung, he speaks the words:\n\n \"From beyond the grave I hear the voices of our founding fathers plead, 'We need God in America again.'\"\n\nThis was the jump scare for me. The image of dead bodies clawing at their coffins, gasping dusty breaths and trying to tell us that we messed up, and it's all over.\n\nFrom there it's a wholly.. well.. holy song, praising God and yearning for him to fix what's broken.\n\n It might sound silly, but the intro is just so intense it made me a little fearful. At the time, I admitted that the song made me a little scared.  The guy who owned the CD told me something along the lines of \"It's good to have the fear of God in you.\" This surely didn't change my views of religion, but also it wasn't the topic of God that made me uneasy, it was the emptiness of it: It was almost like I was in a small room with a judge telling me it was all my fault, while the onlookers cried in the back. \n\n This sensation is what I'm looking for. Something scary and real, something that won't shift the blame and sugar coat what's there, even if it's a message of (God's) love.\n\n I'm not necessarily looking for religious music, or even anti-religious music. Any recommendations would be appreciated.\n\nRock on. I felt that.\n\nMaybe you will like something like\n\n[SOPHIE- Faceshopping](https://youtu.be/es9-P1SOeHU?si=QWsx8JoexRqvMH9j)",

It can tap into our brains and inject pure emotion. I'm sure you can think of plenty of songs that make you happy, sad, angry, hopeful, etc.\n\nI've been looking for music that's actually scary. I'm not sure what that entails, but I've been down rabbit holes all over the internet trying to find something that gives me goosebumps. \n\n I've been through Cradle of Filth, and though their music has plenty of creepy influences and storylines,  they're a little too \"look at me\" to be actually scary.\n \n\"Dance with the Devil\" by Immortal Technique is another one recommended to me. It's a graphic rap song about a kid who'll do anything to get in with the gangbangers, and at the end he does something so horrible, he can't stand himself.\n\n So far, the only song that actually made me uncomfortable to listen to was one from a long time ago, maybe mid 90's. Don't laugh, but it was from a Christian singer known as \"Carman\". The song was called \"God In America Again\".\n\n Before I go further, let me clarify I am not a Christian, nor am I particularly religious in any sense. However, the beginning of this song is simple:\n\nIt starts as a spoken word about the founding fathers, with a solemn sounding Gospel choir in the background, along with a sparse bass drum. At around 40 seconds, the drum beat changes into something that might resemble a horror movie right before the jump scare. He talks of how we shook off the chains of tyranny from britain, and declared our independence as a god-fearing Nation. He then goes on about how we've deviated from those Christian values and so we need \"God In America Again\". But the way he speaks about it makes it sound as if we had brought the apocalypse to light. \n\n At the end of the spoken word section, right before a melody is sung, he speaks the words:\n\n \"From beyond the grave I hear the voices of our founding fathers plead, 'We need God in America again.'\"\n\nThis was the jump scare for me. The image of dead bodies clawing at their coffins, gasping dusty breaths and trying to tell us that we messed up, and it's all over.\n\nFrom there it's a wholly.. well.. holy song, praising God and yearning for him to fix what's broken.\n\n It might sound silly, but the intro is just so intense it made me a little fearful. At the time, I admitted that the song made me a little scared.  The guy who owned the CD told me something along the lines of \"It's good to have the fear of God in you.\" This surely didn't change my views of religion, but also it wasn't the topic of God that made me uneasy, it was the emptiness of it: It was almost like I was in a small room with a judge telling me it was all my fault, while the onlookers cried in the back. \n\n This sensation is what I'm looking for. Something scary and real, something that won't shift the blame and sugar coat what's there, even if it's a message of (God's) love.\n\n I'm not necessarily looking for religious music, or even anti-religious music. Any recommendations would be appreciated.\n\nRock on. I gave it a listen. Creepy, broken sounding instrumentation. The lyrics didn't give much, but the subject matter kinda gave me a \"cosmetic surgery overdose\" kinda vibe. The visuals of the video itself were the most disturbing, but nothing too visceral.\n\nNice suggestion, but a 2/5 for me.\nThanks!",

So I am trying to make a playlist that just feels genuine. But so far, all the songs I've found have one weirdly similar factor - they were all made pre-9/11. I know it's a \"le wrong generation\" mindset, but it feels to me as if humanity with all that's been happening, has just straight up lost its ability to make anything soulful. Now all music lyrically feels to me \"Raaaaaah things are terrible let's all cry about how everything is bad\", across all genres.\n\nHere are some examples I already listen to, if others could toss similar heartfelt music, it would be wonderful.\n\nKamelot - Glory, Sailorman's Hymn, Don't You Cry, The Light I Shine On You. Also - Midsummer's Eve is a nice counterexample as it's made in 2023, but it feels like an only heartfelt song in a sea of rage lately.\n\nRusted Root - Send Me On My Way (which, btw I thought is far older, was surpsied it was made in the 90s, but it's roots rock so that is why it sounds like that).\n\nNightwish - Angels Fall First. LOVE that one because it's sad, but it comes from a place where it's genuine, and not \"thoughts and prayers\" if that makes sense.\n\nAny other nice ones?. Idk if this works, but “Sunday Bloody Sunday” by U2 is what came to mind for me",

Such music I listened to in that playlist talks about heartbreak or love that is lost, and not about the unexplainable sadness I have about everything that is going on in my life.   \n  \nLately I've just been feeling very emotionally drained, exhausted, stressed, and I am hoping to find some music that captures that feeling of sadness.   \n  \nPlease recommend a super sad song because I need to feel my emotions to cry it out and be okay again.   \n  \n. hi OP. here is a short (1 hr 45 minutes) spotify playlist of songs i find easy to cry to: [sounds for when words fail](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4CEwcBuWKR3OUv7ZhCZoo9?si=22b28c96a8444394) . the majority are not about heartbreak. I know you requested \"a\" super sad song, so i recommend starting with the first track on that list- it's called \"Michigan\" by the Milk Carton Kids.\n\notherwise, i recommend the album \"Have a Nice Life\" by Deathconsciousness. [spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/album/6MH3CAXp8AN8ELrbex18dM?si=K0i1WgopT2q6zoKwsAcJ2g) \n\n\n\nwishing you the catharsis that you need.",

      "full_context": "[IIL] Songs that feel like a late-night walk after a tough day, like “Motion Picture Soundtrack” by Radiohead or “Night Owl” by Galimatias, [WEWIL]?. Sometimes I go on quiet, reflective walks at night when my thoughts feel heavy, but I don’t want anything too intense, just music that matches that stillness, maybe with a hint of sadness or introspection.\n\n\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\" by Radiohead gives me that floating, surreal feeling. \"Night Owl\" by Galimatias is smooth, moody, and mellow without dragging me down. I also appreciate minimal piano or ambient touches. Vocals are welcome if they add to that late-night vibe.\n\nLately, I’ve been curating a playlist for this exact feeling, I even find some tracks through [**EsMP3.cc**](http://EsMP3.cc) when I want to revisit or download a specific mood offline.\n\nWhat songs give you that “the world is asleep and you're just trying to make peace with the day” energy?\n\nWould love any recs, thank you.. From someone who walks every night:\n\nLove Songs On The Radio by Mojave 3\n\nI’m Transmitting Tonight by Tim Hecker\n\nLazy Calm by Cocteau Twins\n\nLook on Down From The Bridge by Mazzy Star (major Motion Picture Soundtrack vibes)\n\nAlberto Balsalm by Aphex Twin\n\nFalling by Julee Cruise\n\nThe Rip by Portishead\n\nInside Out by Duster\n\nStone in Focus (or #19) by Aphex Twin\n\nDawn Chorus by Thom Yorke\n\nISI by NEU!\n\nRoygbiv by Boards of Canada\n\nMyth by Beach House\n\nSomething in The Room She Moves by Julia Holter\n\nStory of An Artist by Daniel Johnston\n\nMidnight in a Perfect World by DJ Shadow\n\nJulee and Candy by Boards of Canada",

      "full_context": "Why do certain songs make you cry...even when the lyrics don’t apply to your life?. Sometimes a song hits so deep it feels like it pulled something out of you you didn’t even know was there.\n\nYou’re not heartbroken, but a breakup ballad has you staring out the window like you just got divorced.\n\nYou’ve never lost anyone, but a grief song folds you in half like it’s speaking from your own soul.\n\nIt’s not the lyrics. It’s not the story.\n\nIt’s something else.\n\nMaybe it’s the chords.\n\nThe voice.\n\nThe space between the notes.\n\nSo here’s the question:\n\nWhat is it about music that bypasses logic and speaks directly to the body? Why can a song move you emotionally, even when it has nothing to do with your lived experience?\n\nLet’s go deeper than “this song is sad.”\n\nI want to hear your philosophy. Your brain. Your soul.\n\nLet’s talk about the why.... The late great composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein once said (paraphrasing) that music lets us express emotions that cannot be expressed in words; if they could, nobody would bother writing music.\n\nA lot has to do with accessibility, how a piece of music might speak to our own experience even when it is not actually addressing anything in our experience. I stumbled across a solo violinist playing Joji's \"Glimpse of Us,\" which is about a breakup and self-destructive behavior and depression - not really something I've experienced. But the plaintively evocative melody *did* speak to my experience of a lifetime of yearning, of finding love and losing it, in a way that made me break down in tears. Joji wasn't writing about losing a spouse to cancer - but he succeeded.",

I love music and have heard his name mentioned many times, but I never took the time to discover his music.\n\nToday, that changed as his one and only studio album, Grace, was recommended to me by YouTube Music, and I was shocked by the influence he had on other artists. For example, the first song, Mojo Pin, instantly reminded me of The Antlers’ album Hospice and how his weeping, ascending vocals conveyed the vulnerability of life.\n\nThere were many moments while listening to this album when I felt like crying, though I couldn’t quite explain why. From the haunting opening melody of Hallelujah to his rendition of Lost Highway—a song written by Hank Williams but often linked to Bob Dylan—his raw talent was undeniable. He effortlessly shaped his vocals, shifting from soulful laments to folksy crooning with an almost hypnotic ease.\n\nAnother standout was Jeff’s rendition of the jazz standard Lilac Wine by the great Nina Simone. Call me silly, but I prefer his version, which feels more suitable for the misty and transcendent lyrics of the song.\n\nShowing his versatility, songs like Eternal Life revealed a more hardcore side of Jeff. His vocal range and kaleidoscopic guitars make you think he could have gone down another path and become a metal vocalist.\n\nOf course, listening to the extended version of Grace meant a two-hour album, and I was bound to come across some less remarkable songs, like Kangaroo, which was a full instrumental that lasted longer than needed, with unrelenting guitar and rattling drums that amounted to almost nothing.\n\nWhat made Jeff a standout was his unparalleled vocals and transformative talent across a myriad of songs, along with the accompaniment of supporting instruments.\n\nIt’s simply sad that he left so soon, and the world was robbed of the chance to bask in his later works had he only lived longer.

For example, the first song, Mojo Pin, instantly reminded me of The Antlers’ album Hospice and how his weeping, ascending vocals conveyed the vulnerability of life.\n\nThere were many moments while listening to this album when I felt like crying, though I couldn’t quite explain why. From the haunting opening melody of Hallelujah to his rendition of Lost Highway—a song written by Hank Williams but often linked to Bob Dylan—his raw talent was undeniable. He effortlessly shaped his vocals, shifting from soulful laments to folksy crooning with an almost hypnotic ease.\n\nAnother standout was Jeff’s rendition of the jazz standard Lilac Wine by the great Nina Simone. Call me silly, but I prefer his version, which feels more suitable for the misty and transcendent lyrics of the song.\n\nShowing his versatility, songs like Eternal Life revealed a more hardcore side of Jeff. His vocal range and kaleidoscopic guitars make you think he could have gone down another path and become a metal vocalist.\n\nOf course, listening to the extended version of Grace meant a two-hour album, and I was bound to come across some less remarkable songs, like Kangaroo, which was a full instrumental that lasted longer than needed, with unrelenting guitar and rattling drums that amounted to almost nothing.\n\nWhat made Jeff a standout was his unparalleled vocals and transformative talent across a myriad of songs, along with the accompaniment of supporting instruments.\n\nIt’s simply sad that he left so soon, and the world was robbed of the chance to bask in his later works had he only lived longer. With that said, at least he left us with his Grace.. Back in the early 2000s, I was in my twenties when I read in an interview that Ben Harper’s favorite musician was someone named Jeff Buckley, whom I had never heard of. I mentioned it to a colleague of mine, and he lent me *Grace* and *Mystery White Boy*. I didn’t know anything about him—I thought he was just some musician from the past.\n\nThat night, I was in my room with some friends, and I put on *Grace* while we were chatting. At some point, we all stopped talking, completely floored by what we were hearing.\n\nThat was the day my taste in music changed forever.",

As a experimental music fan, I’ve been looking for different types of music that I’ve been slowly getting into between country, rock, hip hop, alternatives, n what not, but I’ve always had a sweet spot for sad music. I’m not particularly a sad individual; I just feel like sad music conveys emotion into art in ways other genres cannot do. So I was wondering, personally, what is the saddest song you’ve ever heard?\n\nFrom everything.

I felt as if I don’t have any purpose so I tried creating online business failed, fashion I never started I still wanna do in the future but not now. Then I got to music i did music all through middle and up until 10th grade I quit to focus on football. But i wasn’t until recently that I got back into music and I fell in love.\n\nWhen I say I fell in love I mean it. I was at a friends house watching him produce som music and he is still in the beginning stage of producing and I was there and I was like oh my I need to do this. So I got home and told myself I wanna be an artist. Now I believe I can truly do anything but i just be having my moments sometimes. The next day before I went to work I played some music on I was listen to sing I haven’t heard before in the genre I wanna do now I played the song “That Girl” by Pharrell Williams, and when I tell you i cried not bc it was sad or anything bc of how beautiful it was. I was like I can create stuff like this too. That’s what’s baffled me that anyone can make stuff like this with time yk.\n\nSo I become obsessed I’m into like a week now I actually made my first full beat on the 3rd day and it actually wasn’t that bad for my first ever beat. The structure was nice had a bridge chorus and all but obviously me being beginner I’m sure you can expect what it probably sounded like. And the more I work on the more I fall in love like I’m ready to drop everything in my life to pursue this full time kinda in love. You know when people say you are gonna know when u find your purpose I feel like this is it. It keeps me up at night. 3am-4am can’t sleep bc im just thinking about it. And I kid you not I went to sleep and 4x in 2 weeks I had dreams about practicing and getting tips from the beta producers in that game I kid you not. I wake up around 7 full energized bc the thought of creating is on my mind.\n\nI made a 2nd beat now my dad use to rap and be and an actual producer and I have some friend show does it and they said my 2 beats has amazing potential the told me what I needed to fix but I already knew bc I immersed myself into this realm so much alr. I knew what it was missing I just couldn’t think of what to put. They said not just cause ur a beginner but the best I made had really good potential for someone to actually have a good song over that might do well. \n\nBut rn I’m creatively blocked and the thought of being sucky and just can’t come up with anything kills me it makes me made bc I know what I can make with time but I’m stuck here at the bottom being trash. I doubt a little but I can quit cause I’m still super obsessed while being trash. Idc if I give up a job for something I just started I want the world to see what I created I put my sweat, tears, time, and heart into this yk. I wanna well ik imma make it someday and I don’t care about the money or rhe fame I just wanna be able to make music man really good music. Ik a lot of the rappers and producers started off in the same spot but it just kills me man. It’s so frustrating bc I have so much passion for this. But it’s bc I’ve been pushing away my creativity for money and other things in the past idk how to tap into that creativity. It also kills me that I can’t write a melody to save my life, it’s like I’ve been blocked for so long when I try to think nothing comes up literally. \n\nBut imma start off learning music theory again but I’m picking up the piano. I need it bad bc me pressing the keys in hopes of something coming up is awful I can’t express myself how I want to. Me trying to make music without music theory is trying to write a love letter the love of your life in a foreign language. You’re trying to express yourself but you can’t bc you can’t explain it with that language yk. But I jus need some advice I wanna make it big I’m hungry I feel like this is what I’m meant to do like i said I have musical background my dad was a rapper and producer a very good one my brother plays trumpet and he just picked up a guitar I played tuba, trombone, now I’m picking up the piano so i can work easier in my DAW. But I believe I can do anything I want in this life man and imma do whatever I want bc if imma die imma die doing what I love f*ck it yk. I overthink a lot.

Idc if I have to grind for 5-10 years straight they may say I’m dumb or it’s not true well listen.\n\nYou can be right for one for one year, 2,3,4,5,10 years idc u can be right for that long but I promise u imma put all of my marbles on me to find a way to tell you, that you cant be right forever. Idc if have to stand outside of a recording studio or label every single day until someone notices me. Like man imma find a way. If I wanted to be on the moon imma find a way. I just need some advice on how to prism through these beginning times and how to not be a perfectionist over the little things yk.\n\n. “What nobody tells people who are beginners — and I really wish someone had told this to me . . . is that all of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, and it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not.\n\nBut your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase. They quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it’s normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story.\n\nIt is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take a while. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”\n - Ira Glass",

I’ve worked in the music industry since the 90’s and started playing instruments at the age of 4. I’m not sure where to start, but here are some things that worked for me. \nSomething important to keep in mind is that no one is a born musician or artist. Some understand it and learn easier than others, like anything, but everyone requires practice to build skill. It’s not easy for anyone to be great. Practice, practice, practice. \nSitting on the couch watching cartoons? Pluck at your guitar while doing so. Going to drop the kids off at the pool? Bring your harmonica. Ya know? \nWhen I was trying to get into the industry, I was determined to do so by any means necessary. I became a studio intern. I became an intern by knowing how to care for common instruments and recording equipment. I learned how to tune drums, intonate and repair guitars, solder patch bays and cables, even learned how to make Elco connectors and kept myself tiny so I could fit into places others couldn’t to run cable or place diffusers. I showed up on studios doorsteps with my drum dial, soldering iron, multimeter and a handful of tools and said “put me to work.” \nThat got me in the door faster than expected, once in I learned more than any school could dream of teaching. \nIn the beginning I was not paid, but I did get a meal a day, and had people around me willing to educate me on anything I asked to be educated on. PRICELESS! \nI became the engineers best friend cause I could do all the things they didn’t want to do and I did it well! I got to sit in and work on sessions with producers, engineers, writers and masters. I wish I could convey how much I learned during those times.  \nI’ve worked with Dr.Dre, Linkin Park, Korn, Stevie Nicks, The Black Eyed Peas, Wu Tang, The Misfits, Tim Burton, sooo many movie and game soundtracks, countless bucket list moments. I’ve even played instruments for things you hear in an almost daily basis as a studio musician. \nGD I typed a lot out, I’m going to end here cause I can go on for days. To sum it up, always be practicing, learn skills studios want, offer those skills for free in exchange for education and the guarantee that you get first dibs on openings you are qualified for when they come around. \nSide note, always pick up your instrument when you are feeling emotional. Let your emotions take control. \nI’m not looking forward to the attack that might come from posting this. I feel really weird about sharing my experiences and I don’t know why, Reddit is intimidating to me LOL.",

      "full_context": "HIT ME HARD AND SOFT REVIEW! . HIT ME HARD AND SOFT a review. \n\n\n\t9 time Grammy and 2 time Oscar award winning artist Billie Eilish has done it again, making yet another chart dominating record of the year. Eilish is famously known for her slow and soul crushing songs that undoubtedly hold some of the most vulnerable lyrics to ever exist. Critics claim her voice is “whispery” and her songs are heavy, oppose to those critics, I do feel as though with this album, there is a sense of growth and Billie has tapped into her confusing adult emotions and shares vocals and feelings that were hidden from the audience in her sophomore and debut album. You can absolutely feel the stableness and maturity in this record, you can hear the confidence in this album when she belts in “Birds of a feather” and “THE GREATEST”. I think it is fair to say no one is doing it like her and Finneas. Eilish takes us on a raw and personal journey from beginning to end, starting the album off with “skinny” and ending it on not much of a lighter note, with “blue”. The middle tracks are what really show off this records range. You are on a roller coaster from start to finish and its almost as if you end up right where you started, which is quite unusual for storytelling albums, but it is done so seamlessly and carefully. I have found recently that no music has really sat with me for too long or lingered. Until this album. I know there are songs on this album I will always come back to during certain points in my life and will stick. Hit me hard and soft is one of the few albums I can deem timeless.\n\nLets begin, \nSKINNY. \n\tThis song is gut wrenching. As well as so palpable and can resinate with so many young women. Billie writes in the first verse “but the old me is still me and maybe the real me and I think she’s pretty.” Hearing those lyrics for the first time took me out of body and made me think back to little me. I think that women especially are expected so much. My initial thought when I pressed play on this song for the first time, was the photos of Billie outside running to her car in a tank top. If you remember this image you probably remember the terror the internet spewed on her for the way she looked. By no means was she heavy, but society has been saturated so much and everything you see online is fake and woman especially are subjected to fit into this perfect agenda. Not to mention this agenda changes every few months. One month, every girl must have a waist the size as computer paper, the next month society deems that only thicker women are attractive, and the next wave is; if you aren’t muscular and fit, you don’t deserve to live. But in this song Billie reflects on a time where she doesn’t look the same as she does now, but maybe that version of her was her in her truest form, that she was brutally beaten out of and was made to believe she needed to stray far away from. Now when she thinks back to that time, it is on a lighter and sadder note, she thinks that version of herself is beautiful and can’t quite comprehend how no one else was able to see that at the time. \n\nLUNCH. \n\tSafe to say the most fun song off the album. People were anticipating this song from the second she played a snippet of it at Coachella. Obviously, the song is jaw dropping hearing it the first time around. It is so fun and playful and is a great song to go to when you just finished crying to the rest of the tracks. I like to think of this song as a breath of air after wallowing in your tears. I think that the shock factor in this song plays a big role in the popularity of it aside from the quirky lyrics and funky beat. I love how Billie plays into this role of a girl just subjecting to anything for another woman. “I could buy her so much stuff.” This line alone cracks me up because it is so simple yet such a real feeling; when you have that first attraction to somebody and things are going well and you just think about all the things you want to do for them and you’re just anticipating seeing them again. I love the excitement of this song. “You need a seat, i'll volunteer.” I love love love this line. I really appreciate how Billie and Finneas alway tap in to their goofy side when writing an album because they always do it in such a creative and fun way that (in this song in particular) feels seductive yet makes you giggle to yourself. \n\nBIRDS OF A FEATHER. \n\tOkay, I feel as though this song is just the beginning to the rollercoaster of emotions we are about to endure for the rest of the album. This to me is still the appetizer of the album along with the first 3 tracks. Birds of a feather is a song that when I listen to, I like to think of my cousin and best friend Nicki, but it can very well be intended for a lover, a mother, a sister, etc. and that is what I love about this track and music in general. It is so subjective and can be so legitimate and real to whatever instance you want it to fit into. One of my favorite things that a few artists like Noah Kahan in “Everywhere, Everything” and Hozier in “Work song” and Billie in “Birds of a Feather” is these 3 songs are primarily based around death, and reference rotting away, or being buried in my grave, but they somehow find a way to see the beauty in that and romanticize it. Although Noah is singing about wanting to love you til were food for the worms to eat, and Hozier is saying no grave can hold my body down, ill crawl home to you, and Billie essentially talks about death throughout this whole song starting off with “I want you to stay til I’m in the grave til I rot away dead and buried til I’m in the casket you carry.” You don’t hear these lines and get queasy or anxious, you hear them and feel soft and you can feel the strength of the love that you may share for another person and how deep the emotion can get. Not to mention Billie belts in this song and I have been waiting for the day she lets one out because her belts are so soft and angelic but you still feel them at your core. \n\nWILDFLOWER.\n\tDown to the meaning behind the title of this song, I cannot get enough of it. Although it is a much softer and sad song, it feels like a much elevated version of her old music. Timeless and heartbreaking are 2 words that immediately come to mind when I hear this song. WILDFLOWER is telling a complex story about two women who at different times in their lives dated the same man. Obviously the song is written through Billies perspective, admitting to the listener that her friend had confided in her when the pair split. Billie was there for her, but come the month of July, it seems Billie had started seeing her friends ex-boyfriend. Now, before you think that Billie is the villain in this story, as you continue to listen you start to understand, there really is no villain, just the complicated and confusing emotions that come with being deeply in love with someone and wondering if when you look into their eyes, do they see another woman? The thing that is so beautiful about specific storytelling in music is that even though it feels very personal to the writer/singer, you still find ways to relate to the song and sometimes, in most cases, the more specific, the more relatable. You’d be lying if you said you never had a partner with and ex and wondered if they thought about said ex when you were together. With all of that being said, I am unsure of my ability to express my love and obsession with this song any further. \n\nTHE GREATEST\n\tWhen Billie and Finneas get into a studio together nobody is safe, in regards to your feelings being completely seen and heard. One thing about these 2, they know how to write a familiar feeling ballad that crescendos into an angsty, hard hitting rock anthem. Similarly to her hit single off her previous album “Happier Than Ever”, “THE GREATEST” starts off slow and calm while she quietly sings about how she completely gave her all to her significant other and getting no reward from the other party to prove it. This is an often theme we see when artists fall in love and realize the feelings may just be one sided. As I stated earlier, although it is quite a specific scenario, it is extremely palpable to so many and helps others feel as though the artist is reading your diary. One line that really stuck out to me is in the bridge, “Just wanted passion from you, just wanted what I gave you. I waited and waited.” Reading it will not do this simple line justice, as she belts with so much emotion you can feel it through your headphones. She describes how she tore herself to pieces waited around restlessly just to in return, not even receive even a fraction of what she gave for this relationship. \n\n\tI will leave this review off with these 5 songs. I have very high hopes this award season for Billie and Finneas, as they usually sweep the oscars clean each year since their debut “When we all fall asleep where do we go?” In summation, I truly feel this album was very calculated and thoughtfully pieced together down to the title tracks and cover art. Each time these 2 put out an album I am oh so eager to get my hands on it and make it my own. This brother and sister duo was made for the music industry and I hope to hear more from them each and every year. \n\\. Do Death Grips- Bottomless Pit now. You will be greatly rewarded.",

      "full_context": "HIT ME HARD AND SOFT REVIEW! . HIT ME HARD AND SOFT a review. \n\n\n\t9 time Grammy and 2 time Oscar award winning artist Billie Eilish has done it again, making yet another chart dominating record of the year. Eilish is famously known for her slow and soul crushing songs that undoubtedly hold some of the most vulnerable lyrics to ever exist. Critics claim her voice is “whispery” and her songs are heavy, oppose to those critics, I do feel as though with this album, there is a sense of growth and Billie has tapped into her confusing adult emotions and shares vocals and feelings that were hidden from the audience in her sophomore and debut album. You can absolutely feel the stableness and maturity in this record, you can hear the confidence in this album when she belts in “Birds of a feather” and “THE GREATEST”. I think it is fair to say no one is doing it like her and Finneas. Eilish takes us on a raw and personal journey from beginning to end, starting the album off with “skinny” and ending it on not much of a lighter note, with “blue”. The middle tracks are what really show off this records range. You are on a roller coaster from start to finish and its almost as if you end up right where you started, which is quite unusual for storytelling albums, but it is done so seamlessly and carefully. I have found recently that no music has really sat with me for too long or lingered. Until this album. I know there are songs on this album I will always come back to during certain points in my life and will stick. Hit me hard and soft is one of the few albums I can deem timeless.\n\nLets begin, \nSKINNY. \n\tThis song is gut wrenching. As well as so palpable and can resinate with so many young women. Billie writes in the first verse “but the old me is still me and maybe the real me and I think she’s pretty.” Hearing those lyrics for the first time took me out of body and made me think back to little me. I think that women especially are expected so much. My initial thought when I pressed play on this song for the first time, was the photos of Billie outside running to her car in a tank top. If you remember this image you probably remember the terror the internet spewed on her for the way she looked. By no means was she heavy, but society has been saturated so much and everything you see online is fake and woman especially are subjected to fit into this perfect agenda. Not to mention this agenda changes every few months. One month, every girl must have a waist the size as computer paper, the next month society deems that only thicker women are attractive, and the next wave is; if you aren’t muscular and fit, you don’t deserve to live. But in this song Billie reflects on a time where she doesn’t look the same as she does now, but maybe that version of her was her in her truest form, that she was brutally beaten out of and was made to believe she needed to stray far away from.

This song jumps right in.\n\nThe Mars Volta, [L'via L'viquez](https://youtu.be/JphZtpafdKY?si=9UZAUsXLTZhfh9rQ)\n\n90s \n\nJeff Buckley was an all around amazing talent. Incredible lyrics, voice, sense of melody and guitar work. [Forget Her](https://youtu.be/yZhHtSJwjq0?si=yhgBQQdeMuDa2__3)\n\nTim Harrington was in The Masters of Reality.

Began playing live in his father's band at around 13. Released his first album, I think, in '71.

Unknown to many he plays on many hit songs from around 80s era. Fun trivia fact...who was aware that Toto were the studio band Michael Jackson used for all of Thriller?\n\n\nLindsey Buckingham, Fleetwood Mac\n\nGlen Campbell,  country music's best?",

Other than a couple obvious people im surprised bands not always mentioned when this question is asked. Let's see what I can add in that direction...\n\n1st suggestion us a band not for everyone but there's no denying the guitarists abilities,  not to mention the other players. This song jumps right in.\n\nThe Mars Volta, [L'via L'viquez](https://youtu.be/JphZtpafdKY?si=9UZAUsXLTZhfh9rQ)\n\n90s \n\nJeff Buckley was an all around amazing talent. Incredible lyrics, voice, sense of melody and guitar work. [Forget Her](https://youtu.be/yZhHtSJwjq0?si=yhgBQQdeMuDa2__3)\n\nTim Harrington was in The Masters of Reality. Serious chops and such a tone..[She Got Me (when she got her dress on)](https://youtu.be/WdbC9oolTTI?si=UQvM6pkOnfq2b8wv)\n\nA couple from the 70s..\n\nMichael Shenker was incredible. Started in the Scorpions then went to UF, which this is from.[Lights Out](https://youtu.be/VT4i1XR9sJI?si=uyMSIRGZyxavJ-5q)\n\nShuggie Otis is a Blues influenced player not too well known because he shied from the limelight. Began playing live in his father's band at around 13. Released his first album, I think, in '71. [Purple](https://youtu.be/PolCoN0ooyM?si=1M2_Jfw-PLeZb4--)\n\nTo name a few more popular people that get recognition in smaller crowds but generally not remembered for their guitars..\n\nPrince\n\nMike Campbell, TP and the Heartbreakers \n\nJohn \"Skunk\" Baxter, remembered most for his work in Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers \n\nSteve Lutherker, Toto bur also a prolific studio musician. Unknown to many he plays on many hit songs from around 80s era. Fun trivia fact...who was aware that Toto were the studio band Michael Jackson used for all of Thriller?\n\n\nLindsey Buckingham, Fleetwood Mac\n\nGlen Campbell,  country music's best?",

Growing up in a town of 300, I’ve seen otherwise.\n\nMy favorite song is Sea of Heartbreak by Don Gibson, and my favorite country musician is definitely George Jones. I like country that was high on speed and likely about to end up going to jail for a gun violation, like Johnny Cash or Jerry Lee Lewis. I am also partial to miserable bastard music and some bit of cornball. One song I've liked recently is Dust in a Baggie by Billy Strings.\n\nHere’s some of my favorites:\n\nDavid Allen Coe - Called me by my name \n\nGeorge Jones - The race is on\n\nDolly Parton - Dumb Blonde\n\nBrooks and Dunne - Neon Moon\n\nJerry Lee Lewis - Crazy Arms\n\nLoretta Lynn - The Pill\n\nJohnny Cash - One Piece at a time\n\nWillie Nelson - Sad Songs and Waltzes\n\nMarty Robbins - Hanging Me Tonight\n\nLoretta Lynn, Merle Haggard - Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man\n\nKenny Rogers - Ruby Don’t take your love to town\n\nWaylon Jennings - Luckenbach, Texas\n. Raise Hell - Brandi Carlile   \n\nMississippi - The Secret Sisters \n\nBlue Over You - Mason Ramsey  \n\nHighway Queen - Mt. Joy (feat Maren Morris)  \n\n4 Mississippi - Chapel Hart \n\nGunpowder & Lead - Miranda Lambert  \n\nA Day Late & A Buck Short - Julia Cole \n\nDaddy Lessons - Beyoncé (feat. The Chicks)",

Problem is, I don’t dig the god/country/family, super patriotic super Christian stuff I hear all over, or the bro country or stuff opining how small town America is the best. Growing up in a town of 300, I’ve seen otherwise.\n\nMy favorite song is Sea of Heartbreak by Don Gibson, and my favorite country musician is definitely George Jones. I like country that was high on speed and likely about to end up going to jail for a gun violation, like Johnny Cash or Jerry Lee Lewis. I am also partial to miserable bastard music and some bit of cornball. One song I've liked recently is Dust in a Baggie by Billy Strings.\n\nHere’s some of my favorites:\n\nDavid Allen Coe - Called me by my name \n\nGeorge Jones - The race is on\n\nDolly Parton - Dumb Blonde\n\nBrooks and Dunne - Neon Moon\n\nJerry Lee Lewis - Crazy Arms\n\nLoretta Lynn - The Pill\n\nJohnny Cash - One Piece at a time\n\nWillie Nelson - Sad Songs and Waltzes\n\nMarty Robbins - Hanging Me Tonight\n\nLoretta Lynn, Merle Haggard - Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man\n\nKenny Rogers - Ruby Don’t take your love to town\n\nWaylon Jennings - Luckenbach, Texas\n. Neko Case - Furnace Room Lullaby album.  It's from 25 years ago but that's recent comparatively.",

I recently just broke up with a guy who was the sweetest angel ever to me because I knew I was hurting him by not reciprocating his feelings. Even though I didn't feel nearly as strongly about him as he did about me, and even though I'm the one who wanted the breakup, I've been doing nothing but crying. Whenever I go through a breakup, I listen to a LOT of music because I find it quite healing, but there's one problem.\n\nIt's the first time I've been the one to be the \"hurter\" and dumper, and I listen to a lot of women who sing about being victimized by heartbreak, so I kind of don't really have many songs to listen to. The main one I've had on loop is \"Already Gone\" by Kelly Clarkson, which pretty perfectly captures how I feel.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? I normally listen to female singers with powerful voices, and my favorite genre is R&B.. Ulver-Soelen Gaaer Bag Aase Need\nBeautiful song always makes me happy",

      "full_context": "My dad just passed away. You probably haven’t heard of him, but he made music that mattered.. Hi everyone. I’m posting here with a heavy heart. My dad, Tommy McLain, passed away this week at the age of 85.\n\nI know most of you probably haven’t heard his name before, and that’s okay. He never chased fame, but he lived for music. He was part of the swamp pop scene in Louisiana, which was music that blends R&B, country, soul, and early rock 'n' roll. In 1966, he had a hit with a cover of “Sweet Dreams” that took him onto the national charts. But his voice that was high, aching, and full of feeling was uniquely his own.\n\nEven in his 80s, he was still chasing songs. Just a couple years ago, he released his first album in over 40 years, an album called [I Ran Down Every Dream](https://tommymclain.bandcamp.com/album/i-ran-down-every-dream)*.* It featured Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, and other legends who saw in my dad what I always did, a heart that broke wide open when it sang.\n\nWhat meant the most to me wasn’t the records or tours (though he had plenty of wild stories). It was how seriously he took the responsibility of being a songwriter. He believed music could save a person’s soul (or at least make their worst day bearable). He’d cry listening to Roy Orbison or sing harmony in the car without realizing. He was, to the very end, in love with the sound of a beautiful song.\n\nIf you’re the kind of person who likes discovering music that *feels* like something, like late night heartbreak or a warm Southern wind, you might connect with Tommy. Start with [“Sweet Dreams”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiABttoehxw&list=RDoiABttoehxw&start_radio=1&pp=ygUZc3dlZXQgZHJlYW1zIHRvbW15IG1jbGFpbqAHAdIHCQnHCQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D) or [“I Ran Down Every Dream.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjBWpQPWFLc&list=RDLjBWpQPWFLc&start_radio=1&pp=ygUWaSByYW4gZG93biBldmVyeSBkcmVhbaAHAQ%3D%3D) Or just listen to him sing [“Before I Grow Too Old,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x93Lbk08gyw&list=RDx93Lbk08gyw&start_radio=1&pp=ygUiYmVmb3JlIGkgZ3JvdyB0b28gb2xkIHRvbW15IG1jbGFpbqAHAdIHCQnHCQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D) and you’ll hear a man holding back time with every note.\n\nThanks for letting me share this here. I know this subreddit is filled with people who live and breathe music, just like my dad did. I think he would’ve loved knowing his songs were still out there, waiting to be found.\n\n  \nEDIT: Thank you everyone for the overwhelmingly kind support of my dad's music. I'm gonna copy below this message someone asked about how to best support my dad's music:\n\nI would recommend Bandcamp since they are the most artist-friendly of all music platforms\n\nHere's his album I Ran Down Every Dream: [https://tommymclain.bandcamp.com/album/i-ran-down-every-dream](https://tommymclain.bandcamp.com/album/i-ran-down-every-dream)\n\nAnd here's my dad's long-lost psychedelic gospel album Moving to Heaven (a bit too on the nose now but still one of my favorites of his): [https://tommymclain.bandcamp.com/album/moving-to-heaven](https://tommymclain.bandcamp.com/album/moving-to-heaven).

      "full_context": "Discovering My Chemical Romance and Radiohead for the first time after years of only listening to classical music. I’m 21 and I’ve basically only listened to classical music and musicals my whole life. My family’s super into it too, my grandma played violin, my grandpa was a pianist, my dad sang opera, and my mom’s a cellist. I play viola and I’m finishing up my degree in music now.\n\nFor me, music was always about beauty, structure, and transcendence. The kind of thing you sit in awe of. I’d hear my classmates talk about My Chemical Romance, especially when they were about to have a concert in our city, but I never paid much attention. My uncle, who I don’t see much, is a rock musician and a huge Radiohead fan, but I never really explored that world either.\n\nThen I went through my first heartbreak, and suddenly the music I grew up with didn’t reach me anymore.

It was messy and raw and human. It let me cry, scream, and sit in my pain without feeling alone. I didn’t even know music could do that, not to erase your feelings but to hold them with you, to scream them back at you, and to remind you that other people have been exactly where you are.\n\nIt just shows how massive music really is, and man, I can’t wait to explore more of it.

I’m 21 and I’ve basically only listened to classical music and musicals my whole life.

I play viola and I’m finishing up my degree in music now.\n\nFor me, music was always about beauty, structure, and transcendence. The kind of thing you sit in awe of. I’d hear my classmates talk about My Chemical Romance, especially when they were about to have a concert in our city, but I never paid much attention.

Mozart and Sondheim, all the stuff I used to turn to, just couldn’t touch that mix of pain and emptiness I was carrying. Out of curiosity I put on My Chemical Romance and Radiohead, and holy hell it felt like something inside me cracked open. I remember listening to Fake Plastic Trees and Welcome to the Black Parade and just thinking, “DAMN!!! THAT HIT!!! SHET!!” It was like the songs were screaming the things I couldn’t put into words myself.\n\nFor the first time, music wasn’t this perfect polished beauty I admired from a distance. It was messy and raw and human. It let me cry, scream, and sit in my pain without feeling alone. I didn’t even know music could do that, not to erase your feelings but to hold them with you, to scream them back at you, and to remind you that other people have been exactly where you are.\n\nIt just shows how massive music really is, and man, I can’t wait to explore more of it.

Joan Baez Writes About U2 at Live Aid *Joan Baez's autobiography, 'And a Voice to Sing With', July 01, 1985\n\n(She wrote this immediately after her performance at Live Aid in the U.S., as she watched other performances on the TV in her hotel.)\n\n\"I see a face I don't recognize on the screen. It must be coming from England because the swaying audience is dotted with union jacks. The singer is dressed in black, and has long, slightly messy brown hair. He is streaming with sweat, and some of his hair is stuck to his cheek, in road map designs, making me want to brush it back. The song is cosmic, heavenly, lilting, and persistent. The singer jumps in the air and stomps around in heavy boots. He doesn't fuck the microphone the way rock stars do when they realize that technology has made it possible for them to extend their egos out over a crowd of thousands. No, this young man is deadly serious about something, and is expressing himself with such tenderness it is enough to break my heart. He calls to the audience. They call back. He sings little bits of songs from the fifties and sixties, all in his utterly unique sound, and they sing back. He is directing a choir. They are the choir, and they are transported. Am I making all of this up? Possibly. The group's name appears next to the Live Aid symbol superimposed over his mystical dance. U2, Live From Wembley Stadium. This is the group my fifteen-year-old advisors have told me to watch. This is the group they say is political, even pacifist. The singer is working his way down toward the crowd, jumping onto a narrow wooden skirt a few feet below the stage. He is gesturing to the crowd, waving someone toward him. He takes the long drop into the orchestra pit, and continues his sign language invitation. Eventually, a young girl is lifted bodily and handed over the fence which separates him from the crowd. She is simply passed over like an offering. She lands on her feet and is in his arms, and he dances with her. She is probably stage-struck and in shock, and her head is sweetly bent down, and for the next few seconds he is cradling her as they dance.\n\nI can't recall ever having seen anything like it in my life. It is an act, but it is not an act. It is a private moment, accepted by seventy thousand people. The dance is short, sensuous, and heartbreakingly tender. He breaks away from her and is helped up to the level just under the stage, and there finds another girl, dances with her the same way. All this while the percussion and hypnotic guitar continue relentlessly, lyrically, with the audience waving their arms back and forth, a part of the ritual. The singer moves back onto the stage, and, still pouring with sweat, continues with the song. His voice is nothing special. It is unsteady and it cracks. But it is compelling, as he is compelling. There is something about his seriousness which has captivated me.\n\nRock stars can look and be serious, but it is usually about themselves or their inflated vision of themselves. None of us who stand in front of a hundred thousand people hearing our voice (and band) amplified, tampered with, echoed, and smoothed into cosmic velveteen can escape certain grandiose delusions about ourselves. But this Irish lad is involved with something more than self-aggrandizement.\n\nGranted, his ego is well intact, and he is a superb showman, but there is something more going on. And I would like to know what it is. That I would like to be wrapped up in his arms like the little English girl there is no doubt. But if my instincts are correct, there is something which preempts flirtations with him. Something bigger than him or me or us combined, or our music combined. Something to do with politics, kids, freshness, and breakthrough. And love.\n\nOut of the hours of Live Aid that I saw by the end of the day, the high point was witnessing the magic of U2.

I see...the little map of hairs stuck to the youthful Christ-like face of the Irish singer from U2.\". U2 walked on the Live Aid stage a college band,  they walked off the stage Superstars - it really did happen that way.\n\nAlso, I’ve always wondered how an Irish band walked on stage at Wembly, sang a song called “Sunday, Bloody Sunday” in the midst of IRA bombings and violence constantly in the news - and not have their message of pacifism confused or misread by a mostly British crowd.  The balls on these guys were huge - at one point Bono just repeatedly screams “NO MORE” referring to the violence on both sides.  \n\nI would love to hear from someone that was there about what it was like - this impassioned plea for an end of violence, and whether there was a uniform sense of agreement or if there was dissension?

People growing up with music in the 60s and 70s often write how ancient the music from the 1950s sounded to them, and that was only a decade back then. \n\nI haven't really explored the 1950s as much. Who was the Kraftwerk of the 1950s? Who was doing things that were completely out of the blue? I only know of Buddy Holly and Johnny Watson amongst the non jazz artists. Aside from that I don't really know, maybe someone with more knowledge can help me out here.",

Do you know if that's a saxophone in the album or just a neat sounding guitar?\n\nRockabilly is the correct term for the subgenre of rock n roll of artists like Elvis, Bill Haley, Carl Perkins, Chuck Berry, etc. It's bluegrass combined with boogie woogie/jump blues, so it has that strong country flavor with an emphasis on guitar (where jump blues and black rock n roll is usually saxophone or piano) and frantic rhythms \n\nJump blues is basically the term for 40s black rock n roll. If it's different than black 50s rock n roll, it's hard to tell exactly how, for me anyway. Most of the \"first\" rock n roll songs people name are technically jump blues. The major difference between this and rockabilly is that black rock n roll has very little country influence.\n\nThe third subcategory of rock n roll is western swing, which I know nothing about haha\n\nWith the British invasion starting in the 60s, rock n roll began to phase out as the usually all white artists gradually lost the swing rhythm that defines rock n roll. In other words, it became regular rock, and dropped the roll, although later groups would occasionally bring back swing or shuffle rhythms, like Lido Shuffle, House is a Rockin, Rock n Roll (Led Zeppelin), Old Time Rock n Roll (Bob Seger), usually for homages to the original rock n roll. Interestingly, Robert Plant also had his rock n roll side project, the Honeydrippers",

      "full_context": "Who was more Important for Rock Music Chuck Berry or Elvis Presley and Why?. When it comes to straight-ahead, R&B-fueled, incredibly original Rock n Roll, Chuck Berry was the originator, the great songwriter and the incredible performer, bringing us songs like You Can’t Catch Me and Johnny B. Good. If I were answering this question only for me, it would be Chuck Berry in a walk. The Rolling Stones were basically a Chuck Berry tribute band at their roots. Chuck Berry, however, never got into as many Middle Class American homes as the Berry-derivative Stones, because he was BLACK.\n\nHowever, Elvis Presley’s influence in spreading the R&R gospel all over the World cannot be denied. John Lennon & Paul McCartney practically worshipped Elvis—but only the early, pre-Army Elvis. He had an amazing voice that could do both hollering R&B and hushed, crooning ballads. Listen to his version of All My Trials, Lord followed by Heartbreak Hotel, and you’ll get an idea of his range. Also, most importantly for getting Rock-and-Roll into (often racist) Middle Class American homes, Elvis was WHITE.\n\nSadly, Elvis was not creative enough to be a great songwriter, and, in the words of the Warren Zevon song “he traded it in for a porcelain monkey and his face on velveteen.” (It’s on the album Life’ll Kill Ya, one of Warren’s greatest.) Elvis sold out quickly as he could. His first movie was exceptional, but later efforts (Blue Hawaii, Viva Las Vegas, etc.) were increasingly pap. Then, when the market for Elvis movies predictably evaporated, he retreated to his home, surrounded by his sycophantic The Memphis Mafia, growing fat on fried peanut butter-banana sandwiches (which must have tasted awesome and might have fattened me up as well, so,I’ve never made one!) The white-and-spangled, giant-collared 1970s Las Vegas disco suit of Elvis’s later career, and the paranoia that caused him to ask Nixon to ban the Beatles from the USA and ask for an FBI badge, pretty much erased my childhood memories of the great, pre-army, Rock and Roll Elvis, singing Hound Dog. I remember the day his death was announced, feeling pretty much nothing, as I watched a ten-years-older friend (the age of John and Paul) genuinely grieve. I think your take on Elvis might depend heavily on your age in the late 1970s.\n\nSo, in the end, my answer must be Chuck Berry, who never betrayed his music.\n\n\nChuck Berry basically single handedly invented the lead guitar riff and also wrote his own songs.\n\nIn the 50s it was Elvis as a populiser & promoter of the style which he also contributed to in no small way due to his voice, charisma, magnetic TV performances and intuitive knowledge of the pout-pourri of artists that fed into what became a new genre.\n\nBut in the long term in 2021 Chuck Berry influenced more musicians and his was the template that much popular music would follow. As a composer he set the American Teen Dream to words and as a guitarist he brought blues licks, riffs & showmanship into rock n roll. The song writing musician and self contained band moreso than interpretation defined the great rock ‘n’ roll artists that followed.\n\nThere are just so many that contributed to Rock n Roll, boiling it down to just two artists is really a travesty but if you must; Rock n Roll needed both men and while in many of our hearts it's Elvis, in the long term it was Chuck Berry.\n\nIn the racist USA of the 1950s the emerging rock & roll music would have got nowhere without white artists like Elvis performing and breaking down racial barriers with the new blend of white country and black rhythm and blues.\n\nChuck Berry was doing the very same thing, and arguably better but would have been ignored completely if it were not for Elvis, Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins & co.\n\nAs it was, the music of black rock & rollers such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard was largely forgotten within a few years until the arrival of the Beatles who played the music of their black heroes, refused to play to segregated audiences and led a new generation to rediscover the black pioneers of rock & roll.\n\nInnovative Songwriting: Chuck Berry is often credited with creating the template for rock and roll music.

When it comes to straight-ahead, R&B-fueled, incredibly original Rock n Roll, Chuck Berry was the originator, the great songwriter and the incredible performer, bringing us songs like You Can’t Catch Me and Johnny B. Good. If I were answering this question only for me, it would be Chuck Berry in a walk. The Rolling Stones were basically a Chuck Berry tribute band at their roots. Chuck Berry, however, never got into as many Middle Class American homes as the Berry-derivative Stones, because he was BLACK.\n\nHowever, Elvis Presley’s influence in spreading the R&R gospel all over the World cannot be denied. John Lennon & Paul McCartney practically worshipped Elvis—but only the early, pre-Army Elvis. He had an amazing voice that could do both hollering R&B and hushed, crooning ballads. Listen to his version of All My Trials, Lord followed by Heartbreak Hotel, and you’ll get an idea of his range. Also, most importantly for getting Rock-and-Roll into (often racist) Middle Class American homes, Elvis was WHITE.\n\nSadly, Elvis was not creative enough to be a great songwriter, and, in the words of the Warren Zevon song “he traded it in for a porcelain monkey and his face on velveteen.” (It’s on the album Life’ll Kill Ya, one of Warren’s greatest.) Elvis sold out quickly as he could. His first movie was exceptional, but later efforts (Blue Hawaii, Viva Las Vegas, etc.) were increasingly pap. Then, when the market for Elvis movies predictably evaporated, he retreated to his home, surrounded by his sycophantic The Memphis Mafia, growing fat on fried peanut butter-banana sandwiches (which must have tasted awesome and might have fattened me up as well, so,I’ve never made one!) The white-and-spangled, giant-collared 1970s Las Vegas disco suit of Elvis’s later career, and the paranoia that caused him to ask Nixon to ban the Beatles from the USA and ask for an FBI badge, pretty much erased my childhood memories of the great, pre-army, Rock and Roll Elvis, singing Hound Dog. I remember the day his death was announced, feeling pretty much nothing, as I watched a ten-years-older friend (the age of John and Paul) genuinely grieve. I think your take on Elvis might depend heavily on your age in the late 1970s.\n\nSo, in the end, my answer must be Chuck Berry, who never betrayed his music.\n\n\nChuck Berry basically single handedly invented the lead guitar riff and also wrote his own songs.\n\nIn the 50s it was Elvis as a populiser & promoter of the style which he also contributed to in no small way due to his voice, charisma, magnetic TV performances and intuitive knowledge of the pout-pourri of artists that fed into what became a new genre.\n\nBut in the long term in 2021 Chuck Berry influenced more musicians and his was the template that much popular music would follow. As a composer he set the American Teen Dream to words and as a guitarist he brought blues licks, riffs & showmanship into rock n roll. The song writing musician and self contained band moreso than interpretation defined the great rock ‘n’ roll artists that followed.\n\nThere are just so many that contributed to Rock n Roll, boiling it down to just two artists is really a travesty but if you must; Rock n Roll needed both men and while in many of our hearts it's Elvis, in the long term it was Chuck Berry.\n\nIn the racist USA of the 1950s the emerging rock & roll music would have got nowhere without white artists like Elvis performing and breaking down racial barriers with the new blend of white country and black rhythm and blues.\n\nChuck Berry was doing the very same thing, and arguably better but would have been ignored completely if it were not for Elvis, Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins & co.\n\nAs it was, the music of black rock & rollers such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard was largely forgotten within a few years until the arrival of the Beatles who played the music of their black heroes, refused to play to segregated audiences and led a new generation to rediscover the black pioneers of rock & roll.\n\nInnovative Songwriting: Chuck Berry is often credited with creating the template for rock and roll music.

      "full_context": "Country music is a caricature of what romantic music used to be. Anyone else tired of hearing country music at bars and pretty much everywhere you go? Like, seriously, who else isn’t sick of all these posers pretending to be romantic — when in the end, they all sound the same, singing the same generic stuff about breakups, God, and “country,” with a beer in one hand while driving some ugly pickup down a dirt road?\n\nIt’s funny how country music has tried to crown itself as the “romantic” or “introspective” genre of the 2020s, when what it really sells is a cartoon of rugged masculinity — tattooed guys with beer in one hand and God in the other, growling into the mic about heartbreak in the most generic way possible. There’s nothing truly romantic or idealistic about it. It’s a cosplay of depth.\n\nThe real romanticism — the tender, melodic kind that spoke to the soul — belonged to the early 2010s. Artists like Birdy, Gabrielle Aplin, Kodaline, James Bay, Tom Odell, Aurora, Daughter, Rhodes, George Ezra, Lauren Aquilina, Andrew Belle… even later ones like Lewis Capaldi and Dean Lewis. That was music written by people who felt deeply, not by men trying to look deep while flexing their biceps in a flannel shirt. Compare Luke Combs to James Bay and tell me who the real romantic is. One sings like he’s confessing under the rain; the other like he’s preaching in a truck commercial.. This post should have started \"dear diary\"\n\nYou aren't listening to enough music because there is tons of great country and even other genres with more depth and gravity than Lewis Capaldi.",

      "full_context": "Why do girls/women listen to music from boys/men more than boys/men listen to music from girls/women?. The top five themes of the most popular songs in history are:  \n**Love**, **Empowerment**, **Partying**, **Social Commentary**, and **Nostalgia**.\n\nI asked ChatGPT to break these themes down by gender—male artists, female artists, and male/female duets—and here’s the rough approximation it gave (grain of salt, of course):\n\n|**Theme**|**Male Artists**|**Female Artists**|**Both**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Love|50%|35%|15%|\n|Empowerment & Confidence|40%|45%|15%|\n|Partying & Escapism|60%|25%|15%|\n|Social/Political Commentary|70%|20%|10%|\n|Nostalgia & Reflection|55%|30%|15%|\n\nSo male artists dominate most themes, except empowerment, where female-led songs (especially pop anthems during the feminist wave) do a lot of the work.\n\nThis likely reflects the historical dominance of men in the music industry. As women gain more representation, we may see the gender breakdown even out.\n\nBut to answer the question—**why women tend to listen to men more than men listen to women**—a few things stood out.\n\n# 1. Exposure and Volume\n\nThere are simply more popular songs by men. If 60–70% of all major charting music is male-led, people—regardless of gender—are going to be exposed to more male voices by default.\n\n# 2. Relatability and Socialization\n\nTake **love songs**, for example. Boys aren’t taught to idealize love the same way girls are. But a man singing about love can still appeal to both:\n\n* **Women**, who romanticize the singer or the scenario.\n* **Men**, who relate to the lyrics or picture themselves as the guy singing.\n\nMeanwhile, love songs by women often feel like they’re *to* other women. Straight guys typically aren’t socialized to fantasize about being serenaded by a woman. They might find her attractive but don’t emotionally plug into the lyrics the same way.\n\nThis reflects a broader pattern: **women are taught to fantasize about relationships**, while **men often engage with women as aesthetic objects**, not emotional voices. Think: girls with posters of boy bands dreaming about being sung to vs. guys with Megan Thee Stallion posters thinking... less about lyrics and more about looks.\n\n# 3. Empowerment and Party Tracks\n\nMany female empowerment anthems are just that—**for women**. Same with party songs that lean heavily into feminine-coded experiences, language, or dancing.\n\nIt’s not toxic for a guy to say, “This song’s not for me,” when it’s Cardi B talking about what she wants a man to do sexually. That’s fair. Similarly, most straight guys aren’t looking to twerk—or be told to.\n\n# 4. Different Fantasies\n\nWomen often like **songs that feel like a personal serenade**—love ballads, heartfelt duets, etc. It gives them a parasocial vibe, like a man is singing *to* them.\n\nMen have parasocial relationships too, but more **visual/aesthetic** ones—e.g., simping for OnlyFans creators or celebrity crushes. They’re not looking to be emotionally serenaded by a woman artist.\n\nSo when women hear a guy sing about longing, heartbreak, or romance, it taps into something that men are rarely trained to want or imagine receiving from a woman.\n\n# 5. My Experience\n\nPersonally, some of my favorite songs are ballads from male artists or duets. As a kid, I’d picture myself singing them to specific girls. I imagined being someone like MJ or Usher on stage.\n\nThat said, I listened to plenty of female artists too. Sometimes I’d “gender-bend” songs from Ashanti or imagine myself singing them to a guy (I’m bi). I even enjoy songs like **WAP** when I’m feeling extra zesty. But yeah, I totally get why straight guys might feel awkward with it. Not everyone wants to be serenaded by Cardi B telling them what to do in bed.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n* Male artists dominate most themes in popular music.\n* Women are socialized to engage emotionally with music and fantasy more than men.\n* Men engage more with music through aesthetics than emotional identification, especially with female-led songs.\n* Love, empowerment, and party tracks often resonate more deeply with women due to how they’re written and who they’re written for.\n* Women listen to men more because men dominate the music landscape and often tap into emotional/relational fantasies women are socialized to enjoy.\n\nLet me know your thoughts—especially if you grew up listening differently or break this mold in your own music tastes.. Women tend to be the trendsetters of music/the ones who make an artist famous. \n\nLook at the images of The Beatles or the Stones landing at American airports. It’s all young women. Women statistically across every genre of music purchase more concert tickets merch/physical music. \n\nAnd despite literally being the reason a lot of these musicians have careers, they’re still mistreated/underminded, even harassed/abused by male musicians",

And we are talking Black women, one of which is single mom. \n\nIn many ways, women are more vulnerable than men in ways that women and men need to be aware of for the safety of their loved ones. But to say they are second class citizens assumes they are largely and systemically denied freedom for reasons beyond their own control.",

      "full_context": "Why do girls/women listen to music from boys/men more than boys/men listen to music from girls/women?. The top five themes of the most popular songs in history are:  \n**Love**, **Empowerment**, **Partying**, **Social Commentary**, and **Nostalgia**.\n\nI asked ChatGPT to break these themes down by gender—male artists, female artists, and male/female duets—and here’s the rough approximation it gave (grain of salt, of course):\n\n|**Theme**|**Male Artists**|**Female Artists**|**Both**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Love|50%|35%|15%|\n|Empowerment & Confidence|40%|45%|15%|\n|Partying & Escapism|60%|25%|15%|\n|Social/Political Commentary|70%|20%|10%|\n|Nostalgia & Reflection|55%|30%|15%|\n\nSo male artists dominate most themes, except empowerment, where female-led songs (especially pop anthems during the feminist wave) do a lot of the work.\n\nThis likely reflects the historical dominance of men in the music industry. As women gain more representation, we may see the gender breakdown even out.\n\nBut to answer the question—**why women tend to listen to men more than men listen to women**—a few things stood out.\n\n# 1. Exposure and Volume\n\nThere are simply more popular songs by men. If 60–70% of all major charting music is male-led, people—regardless of gender—are going to be exposed to more male voices by default.\n\n# 2. Relatability and Socialization\n\nTake **love songs**, for example. Boys aren’t taught to idealize love the same way girls are. But a man singing about love can still appeal to both:\n\n* **Women**, who romanticize the singer or the scenario.\n* **Men**, who relate to the lyrics or picture themselves as the guy singing.\n\nMeanwhile, love songs by women often feel like they’re *to* other women. Straight guys typically aren’t socialized to fantasize about being serenaded by a woman. They might find her attractive but don’t emotionally plug into the lyrics the same way.\n\nThis reflects a broader pattern: **women are taught to fantasize about relationships**, while **men often engage with women as aesthetic objects**, not emotional voices. Think: girls with posters of boy bands dreaming about being sung to vs. guys with Megan Thee Stallion posters thinking... less about lyrics and more about looks.\n\n# 3. Empowerment and Party Tracks\n\nMany female empowerment anthems are just that—**for women**. Same with party songs that lean heavily into feminine-coded experiences, language, or dancing.\n\nIt’s not toxic for a guy to say, “This song’s not for me,” when it’s Cardi B talking about what she wants a man to do sexually. That’s fair. Similarly, most straight guys aren’t looking to twerk—or be told to.\n\n# 4. Different Fantasies\n\nWomen often like **songs that feel like a personal serenade**—love ballads, heartfelt duets, etc. It gives them a parasocial vibe, like a man is singing *to* them.\n\nMen have parasocial relationships too, but more **visual/aesthetic** ones—e.g., simping for OnlyFans creators or celebrity crushes. They’re not looking to be emotionally serenaded by a woman artist.\n\nSo when women hear a guy sing about longing, heartbreak, or romance, it taps into something that men are rarely trained to want or imagine receiving from a woman.\n\n# 5. My Experience\n\nPersonally, some of my favorite songs are ballads from male artists or duets. As a kid, I’d picture myself singing them to specific girls. I imagined being someone like MJ or Usher on stage.\n\nThat said, I listened to plenty of female artists too. Sometimes I’d “gender-bend” songs from Ashanti or imagine myself singing them to a guy (I’m bi). I even enjoy songs like **WAP** when I’m feeling extra zesty.

      "full_context": "Kanye West [RnB, Rap, soul rap] is, however you twist and turn it, a musical genius. And I can prove it (scroll to third paragraph to read the actual post). Fuck you, I’m NOT calling him ye.\n\nAlright, I wanna start by making some obvious disclaimers. No, I do not agree nor support anything hate speech Kanye has expressed during the last few years. I also understand that this is a controversial topic and I completely respect it if the mods remove this post. I am not active on this server so I don’t know the norms, but I’m making sure I don’t break any of the written rules or guidelines at least. I am also aware that, considering the topic, is a post that probably has been repeated multiple times before, and can be removed for repeat of a common post. But I needed to say this somewhere and I knew that people in r/rap and r/kanye would just agree with me. And where’s the fun in that?\n\nNow with that long ass intro out of the way, I can keep going with the actual post. Let’s not bs, and start with the facts. Kanye has synesthesia. What this means is that Kanye can literally see sound. He himself has described it as “[being able to paint a picture] with every beat and every sound in the song”. To him, a snare or a drum kick is a small part of a big puzzle to a painting that he’s making. Many other artists, especially good ones, Billy Joel for example or even great visual artists like Vincent Van Gogh (his vibrant colours are a proof of this) are thought to experience music the same way. Kanyes ability to literally see sound lets him create music in ways that on a scientific standpoint is harder for others. His first album, TCD, is the first of its kind. The use of soul samples, the dramatic beats and sometimes chill beats. The not over the top lyricism and the lack of gangster lyrics. It was different, and he followed it up with Late Registration, an album that blended live orchestras with beautiful studio performances, the first in rap to do such a thing. Graduation, considered his best album, blends electronic music, and unlike his music up to now, tackles real world issues and does so very well. He follows that up with 808s & Heartbreak. THE most influential album in hiphop I’d argue of all time. If it wasn’t for this album, we wouldn’t have 90% of rappers we call “the greatest of all time” today. After a short self exile after the Taylor Swift incident, he releases My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, considered a hiphop staple and one of the greatest of all time. The maximalism on this album give a feeling no other album can give. He proceeds this album with some of the most futuristic albums to exist. All of them way ahead of their time, Yeezus with its rage and it’s one of if not the first completely experimental hiphop albums of all time, that essentially was a big “fuck you” to the world. Then we have The Life of Pablo was also extremely experimental, got hate but grew into fans later on. Kids See Ghost is arguably one of Kanyes best, and also that saw a lot of hate when released. Heck ye, which everyone who listens to a lot of Kanye agrees is a top 5 Kanye album of all time, was hated on when released, mind you this album had GHOST TOWN, yes THE Ghost Town. Even albums like DONDA, which was seen as unfinished and full of fillers, has grown into fans, cause it takes time to take in the creativeness in some of these albums. Even Vultures 1 has started to gain some traction, and if you remember that was like THE album to hate on back when it released. His new stuff may be… bad but it doesn’t take away from the fact that he is, in his own words: “IM A GEINUS” Say what you want about Kanye. But he IS a creative genius and one of the greatest artists of all time. He has done some fucked up shit, and his undeniably good music is not an excuse for that, but he is a creative genius. There is no denying that.. You can die on that hill if you wish. But if Hitler was Rembrandt or vice versa, he would still be an \\*sshole. When you are bad, it does not make up for the good.
