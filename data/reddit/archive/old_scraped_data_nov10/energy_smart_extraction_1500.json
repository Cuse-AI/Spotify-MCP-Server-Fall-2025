Offspring, Blink-182, Dropkick Murphys, Pennywise, Raised Fist, Radkey, Off With Their Heads, Royal Blood, and a smattering of other similar bands. \n\nI like the music to be fast and/or have a solid \"pulsating\" beat, but I still need to understand the lyrics. Any recommendations?. Some Rock/Metal mostly without screams but high tempo and/or driving beat:\n\n**Within Temptation** - Faster, The Fire Within\n\n**Dymytry** - Enemy List\n\n**Chevelle** - Self Destructor, Mars Simula, Get Some, Face to the Floor\n\n**Sabaton** - The Valley of Death, Primo Victoria, The Last Battle, Shiroyama, Blood of Bannockburn, Attack of the Dead Men\n\n**Mammoth WVH** - Mr Ed, Mammoth, Don't Back Down\n\n**The Warning** - Animosity, Evolve, Dull Knives, Ugh, Sharks\n\n**Shinedown** - Planet Zero\n\n**Alter Bridge** - Dead Among the Living, Isolation\n\n**Halestorm** - Back from the Dead\n\n**Freeze the Fall** - Daughters of Witches\n\n**Bad Omens** - Limits, Like A Villain\n\n**Adelitas Way** - Sick\n\n**Breaking Benjamin** - I Will Not Bow, Blow Me Away",

Been really enjoying the latest album \"Blue Sky Mentality\" from the Good Neighbors, very fun and upbeat. Found them recently  and I really like their sound.\n\nOKGo is another one of my favorite artists, if you haven't watched their music videos you're in for a treat. Most of their work is similarly upbeat, and imo their last album \"And the Adjacent Possible\" was quite good.",

I recently started getting into “hot girl rap” and I really like Megan Thee Stallion and City Girls, however I dislike how much the songs tend to talk about sexual stuff! I was recently introduced to ‘Otherside’ by the Red Hot Chilli Peppers and I really like it, especially at the weird breakdown thing in the bridge!

There are a lot of playlists made on Spotify that are said to be for mentally, and emotionally drained/ depressed people but none captures the feeling I am feeling. Such music I listened to in that playlist talks about heartbreak or love that is lost, and not about the unexplainable sadness I have about everything that is going on in my life.   \n  \nLately I've just been feeling very emotionally drained, exhausted, stressed, and I am hoping to find some music that captures that feeling of sadness.   \n  \nPlease recommend a super sad song because I need to feel my emotions to cry it out and be okay again.   \n  \n.

I get what you mean but streaming services are a very convenient way of listening to music anytime and everywhere. And it's pretty cheap in the long run, if you use it often and listen to several different artists. You can still buy CDs and Vinyls from a lot of different artists, by the way, and they have become quite popular again, much more so than say 10 years ago. And that's pretty cool. A lot of people do that but use streaming services as well. \n\nI guess it also depends on how you use Spotify. I never like the playlists that Spotify creates for me, but I can always make playlists myself or just listen to music by albums and I do that to discover music I haven't heard.\n\nI prefer Tidal when it comes to UI and quality, they pay artists more money, so you might want to try that. Sadly, Tidal doesn't have podcasts I listen and some of the songs I listen so I reluctantly chose Spotify because I don't want to pay for 2 music services...",

      "full_context": "My Apple Music experience as a long term Spotify user. **Why I thought about switching**\n\nSo, I’ve been using Spotify for a couple of years and everything was fine. However, then they suddenly rise pricing. And even though it’s only one dollar and it seems there is no difference, there actually is. For example, I use family plan and for this pricing option it’s $3 rise. So in a year it’s a $36 difference. But I didn’t mind it and still continued using Spotify. And after another 6 months, maybe, a bit more there is the same price rise again. So, for my plan annually it’s $72 difference from the original price. Then, Apple releases this Liquid Glass update and out of curiosity eventually I downloaded the beta to try it out. I really liked the new UI and saw new Apple Music features, so I decided to finally give this program a shot.\n\n**Features I like in Apple Music**\n\nFirst of all, the design of Apple Music is amazing. I really like the design of apps made by Apple, so obviously I liked Apple Music. The Mac app is kind of worse than IOS/IPadOS versions, but I use it mainly on IOS, so it wasn’t a problem. And since Spotify is an electron app, Apple Music obviously wins on IOS, because of how great it’s optimized for this particular OS. I also enjoyed the lyrics feature so much, this feature’s design is amazing and way better than in Spotify. Also, I liked the replay playlists or top 100 in your country stuff in Apple Music, it’s kind of handy to be able to access such playlists easily and that they are updated frequently. The sound quality is amazing too. Even songs from totally unknown artists are level.\n\n**Features I miss from Spotify**\n\nWhat I miss from Spotify though is the sidebar. For example, I don’t need radio and a couple of other tabs in Apple Music, in Spotify there is home, search and library. Simple, easy and convenient. Another feature I miss is showing an amount of views in the top songs tab. It seems like a small thing, but I immediately notice it. Also, it’s probably the most controversial thing I’m going to say here, but I like music recommendations slightly more in Spotify. It suggests tracks from new artists I don’t know, but their music is very similar to the one I’m listening. Apple Music sometimes suggests something from the artists that I listen often to, but sometimes from artists I listened a long time ago, and that I don’t want to listen right now.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI made the switch to Apple Music, because of the pricing, design and sound quality. Yes, there are features I miss from Spotify, yes Apple Music has its limitations, yes Apple Music is the better choice obviously only on Apple platforms.

      "full_context": "My Apple Music experience as a long term Spotify user. **Why I thought about switching**\n\nSo, I’ve been using Spotify for a couple of years and everything was fine. However, then they suddenly rise pricing. And even though it’s only one dollar and it seems there is no difference, there actually is. For example, I use family plan and for this pricing option it’s $3 rise. So in a year it’s a $36 difference. But I didn’t mind it and still continued using Spotify. And after another 6 months, maybe, a bit more there is the same price rise again. So, for my plan annually it’s $72 difference from the original price. Then, Apple releases this Liquid Glass update and out of curiosity eventually I downloaded the beta to try it out. I really liked the new UI and saw new Apple Music features, so I decided to finally give this program a shot.\n\n**Features I like in Apple Music**\n\nFirst of all, the design of Apple Music is amazing. I really like the design of apps made by Apple, so obviously I liked Apple Music. The Mac app is kind of worse than IOS/IPadOS versions, but I use it mainly on IOS, so it wasn’t a problem. And since Spotify is an electron app, Apple Music obviously wins on IOS, because of how great it’s optimized for this particular OS. I also enjoyed the lyrics feature so much, this feature’s design is amazing and way better than in Spotify. Also, I liked the replay playlists or top 100 in your country stuff in Apple Music, it’s kind of handy to be able to access such playlists easily and that they are updated frequently. The sound quality is amazing too. Even songs from totally unknown artists are level.\n\n**Features I miss from Spotify**\n\nWhat I miss from Spotify though is the sidebar. For example, I don’t need radio and a couple of other tabs in Apple Music, in Spotify there is home, search and library. Simple, easy and convenient. Another feature I miss is showing an amount of views in the top songs tab. It seems like a small thing, but I immediately notice it. Also, it’s probably the most controversial thing I’m going to say here, but I like music recommendations slightly more in Spotify. It suggests tracks from new artists I don’t know, but their music is very similar to the one I’m listening. Apple Music sometimes suggests something from the artists that I listen often to, but sometimes from artists I listened a long time ago, and that I don’t want to listen right now.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI made the switch to Apple Music, because of the pricing, design and sound quality. Yes, there are features I miss from Spotify, yes Apple Music has its limitations, yes Apple Music is the better choice obviously only on Apple platforms. With that being said, I don’t regret the switch, but totally understand those who use Spotify and in the end of the day, it’s more about preference and your specific needs, I just shared my experience in case it might help someone.\n\n**🎬 Video**\n\nI also made a video on my YouTube channel [AirTech](https://www.youtube.com/@AirTechnologyChannel) about this topic, where I compare in detail Spotify and Apple Music.

      "full_context": "My Apple Music experience as a long term Spotify user. **Why I thought about switching**\n\nSo, I’ve been using Spotify for a couple of years and everything was fine. However, then they suddenly rise pricing. And even though it’s only one dollar and it seems there is no difference, there actually is. For example, I use family plan and for this pricing option it’s $3 rise. So in a year it’s a $36 difference. But I didn’t mind it and still continued using Spotify. And after another 6 months, maybe, a bit more there is the same price rise again. So, for my plan annually it’s $72 difference from the original price. Then, Apple releases this Liquid Glass update and out of curiosity eventually I downloaded the beta to try it out. I really liked the new UI and saw new Apple Music features, so I decided to finally give this program a shot.\n\n**Features I like in Apple Music**\n\nFirst of all, the design of Apple Music is amazing. I really like the design of apps made by Apple, so obviously I liked Apple Music. The Mac app is kind of worse than IOS/IPadOS versions, but I use it mainly on IOS, so it wasn’t a problem. And since Spotify is an electron app, Apple Music obviously wins on IOS, because of how great it’s optimized for this particular OS. I also enjoyed the lyrics feature so much, this feature’s design is amazing and way better than in Spotify. Also, I liked the replay playlists or top 100 in your country stuff in Apple Music, it’s kind of handy to be able to access such playlists easily and that they are updated frequently. The sound quality is amazing too. Even songs from totally unknown artists are level.\n\n**Features I miss from Spotify**\n\nWhat I miss from Spotify though is the sidebar. For example, I don’t need radio and a couple of other tabs in Apple Music, in Spotify there is home, search and library. Simple, easy and convenient. Another feature I miss is showing an amount of views in the top songs tab. It seems like a small thing, but I immediately notice it. Also, it’s probably the most controversial thing I’m going to say here, but I like music recommendations slightly more in Spotify. It suggests tracks from new artists I don’t know, but their music is very similar to the one I’m listening. Apple Music sometimes suggests something from the artists that I listen often to, but sometimes from artists I listened a long time ago, and that I don’t want to listen right now.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI made the switch to Apple Music, because of the pricing, design and sound quality. Yes, there are features I miss from Spotify, yes Apple Music has its limitations, yes Apple Music is the better choice obviously only on Apple platforms. With that being said, I don’t regret the switch, but totally understand those who use Spotify and in the end of the day, it’s more about preference and your specific needs, I just shared my experience in case it might help someone.\n\n**🎬 Video**\n\nI also made a video on my YouTube channel [AirTech](https://www.youtube.com/@AirTechnologyChannel) about this topic, where I compare in detail Spotify and Apple Music.

Apple Music is better but only if you have an iPhone (and preferable some AirPods cause the ecosystem is perfect). I was a loyal customer for Spotify but then I bought the AirPods 4. When I connected my AirPods to my iPhone I got 3 months free of charge on Apple Music. In my country, Apple Music is the exact same price as Spotify so money wasn’t in the question.

It syncs perfectly to the song and it doesn’t lag at all. Then we have karaoke mode. I’ll give you this: then you turn off the lyrics you can still hear them but if you sing over it it’s not recognisable. I make this with my friends all of the time and we die out of laughter.

The only flaw Apple Music has is that it doesn’t have a “liked songs” playlist or something like that. I really relied on that whilst using Spotify but I just made a separate playlist and named it “Liked Songs”. If you try to save a song in your library it saves you the whole single.

With all this AI music slop being generated, and with my choices being unaffected by it, I felt the urge to write my personal habits on listening. Also take note that I'm a young millenial who was raised on a developing country, so I came from a time and place where Internet wasn't ubiquitous to everyone's life.\n\n1) Try to listen to local musicians around you.\n\nI think it's easier than ever to know if a local musician or band is going to play. In the past, these events are announced only through word of mouth, radio, TV, and physical posters, but now you can use your social media to follow the accounts of places that allow local musicians to perform. These gigs are also usually cheap, and most local musicians are also easier to talk to. If they have some music in streaming services or CDs, you can listen to them or buy their merch.\n\n2) Talk to fellow music lovers and musicians.\n\nAnd listen to their recommendations. Particularly for musicians, some of us would geek out on our influences who happen to be actual people.\n\n3) If the Internet is your source, take time to research the artist who wrote the song that you like.\n\nIt gives you the advantage of verifying if they're real or AI. Plus, you can also listen to the whole album where the song you like is included, so you can immerse yourself better into that artist's discography. \n\n4) There are sites like Bandcamp who promote indie and famous artists alike.\n\n5) Go to music shops and/or secondhand thrift stores.\n\nYou can browse the CDs that they sell. Personally, what I do is for more established artists, I buy secondhand CDs (they come really really cheap) and for local and rising indie artists, I buy new (well, they can also come cheap). CDs not only have higher quality; they also have liner notes. Then I rip them for my personal use (I'm not a pirate) so I can listen to them on the go.\n\n6) Cherish the music that you have.\n\nSince I usually purchase CDs, I would prefer listening to them over other stuff. Probably the exception is jazz, because, while I do buy jazz albums, each live jazz performance is unique by itself due to arrangement, spontaneity of improvisations, and musicality of the instrumentalist. So I would also have playlists of live jazz performances in my YouTube channel. (Also, there's a lot of relatively not known but great jazz musicians all over the world, which performances are uploaded in YouTube).\n\nAnyway, these are my habits which allow me to listen to music made by real people. Also, this post is for people who dislike AI music slop. If  you're an AI music enjoyer or apologist, just stay out because you can't convince me or other people to listen to it.. yeah, I am with you on all these. \n\nI pay money to go see bands play live and most of the music I listen to is by young and/or touring bands.\n\n I buy physical media from the artists themselves first, from in-person retailers second, online retailers third. \n\nI've also bought a lot of digital media, it's stored on a local server so I can simulate a streaming sort of situation but it's all stuff I've purchased over the years.\n\nMy only real guilty pleasure is Spotify, but it tires me.

If I start listening to multiple songs by a new artist, I almost always google them just to find out a bit more about them. I refuse to use Spotify DJ and have the feature that automatically starts playing something else when an album or playlist is over turned off. I do sometimes look for new music on pre-made Spotify playlists, but I pretty much always use the same few alternative music playlists that get updated with new music. At this point, I recognize most of the artists that are frequently added to those playlists. \n\nI think I’m pretty safe from AI just with what I’m already doing. Am I crazy to think that?",

With all this AI music slop being generated, and with my choices being unaffected by it, I felt the urge to write my personal habits on listening. Also take note that I'm a young millenial who was raised on a developing country, so I came from a time and place where Internet wasn't ubiquitous to everyone's life.\n\n1) Try to listen to local musicians around you.\n\nI think it's easier than ever to know if a local musician or band is going to play. In the past, these events are announced only through word of mouth, radio, TV, and physical posters, but now you can use your social media to follow the accounts of places that allow local musicians to perform. These gigs are also usually cheap, and most local musicians are also easier to talk to. If they have some music in streaming services or CDs, you can listen to them or buy their merch.\n\n2) Talk to fellow music lovers and musicians.\n\nAnd listen to their recommendations. Particularly for musicians, some of us would geek out on our influences who happen to be actual people.\n\n3) If the Internet is your source, take time to research the artist who wrote the song that you like.\n\nIt gives you the advantage of verifying if they're real or AI. Plus, you can also listen to the whole album where the song you like is included, so you can immerse yourself better into that artist's discography. \n\n4) There are sites like Bandcamp who promote indie and famous artists alike.\n\n5) Go to music shops and/or secondhand thrift stores.\n\nYou can browse the CDs that they sell. Personally, what I do is for more established artists, I buy secondhand CDs (they come really really cheap) and for local and rising indie artists, I buy new (well, they can also come cheap). CDs not only have higher quality; they also have liner notes. Then I rip them for my personal use (I'm not a pirate) so I can listen to them on the go.\n\n6) Cherish the music that you have.\n\nSince I usually purchase CDs, I would prefer listening to them over other stuff. Probably the exception is jazz, because, while I do buy jazz albums, each live jazz performance is unique by itself due to arrangement, spontaneity of improvisations, and musicality of the instrumentalist. So I would also have playlists of live jazz performances in my YouTube channel. (Also, there's a lot of relatively not known but great jazz musicians all over the world, which performances are uploaded in YouTube).\n\nAnyway, these are my habits which allow me to listen to music made by real people. Also, this post is for people who dislike AI music slop. If  you're an AI music enjoyer or apologist, just stay out because you can't convince me or other people to listen to it..

Perhaps you too have experienced this same scenario in your life and will relate to it in that sense.  \n  \nBeyond that, I had wanted to write an \"epic\" song (one that surpassed 7 minutes in length) for a long time. Not just in the traditional sense of longer-length, but in the sense of having multiple sections and each with their own different theme - all in one work. One day I happened to find myself in unfamiliar territory, plugged my guitar into an amplifier that wasn't mine and began playing by stream-of-consciousness. Thus, the riff that repeats itself throughout this song the most was born. In time, I decided it was good enough to be part of something bigger and continued to build upon it until eventually the final product arrived.",

For me, this also represents something deeper, because it serves as a metaphor for all the times in my life I had to walk away from something I did not want to walk away from in order to start over and rebuild so as to create a better world for myself (if that makes sense). Perhaps you too have experienced this same scenario in your life and will relate to it in that sense.  \n  \nBeyond that, I had wanted to write an \"epic\" song (one that surpassed 7 minutes in length) for a long time. Not just in the traditional sense of longer-length, but in the sense of having multiple sections and each with their own different theme - all in one work. One day I happened to find myself in unfamiliar territory, plugged my guitar into an amplifier that wasn't mine and began playing by stream-of-consciousness. Thus, the riff that repeats itself throughout this song the most was born. In time, I decided it was good enough to be part of something bigger and continued to build upon it until eventually the final product arrived.",

DOCTAH has been heavily involved in music for over 20 years. He started off as a young rave slave traveling round the UK and Europe to see US techno legends like Rob Hood Ben Sims and Derrick May. In the 2010s in Manchester, England, Dubstep/Grime was new and blowing up. Raves like Sequence and Hit & Run were legendary and left a lasting impact on the artist. \"I only like raw music with attitude.\" Living with 7 friends, heavily involved in making music/DJing, then eventually putting on huge shows like Drum Clinic and Warehouse Project events in Manchester, Dr FMW certainly benefited from a stellar musical education (and received more than a few noise complaints along the way). He now produced Dubstep Grime UK Garage, Jungle and Ghetto House.\n\nIt is only in the past few years the Doc fell in love with producing after regularly being asked for advice by friends who were making music at the time. Something clicked. Starting in 2023, after teaching himself the ropes, there were quite a few label releases on various labels/genres (Dakrheart/MOR). Despite his inexperience, Juno picked out \"Hollow Head\" as one of their favorite dubstep tracks of the year in 2023, ahead of acts like Hamdi. As a member of a collective called \"E-180\" with some incredible artists across Europe and beyond, there has been lots cooking including an upcoming compilation coming soon, which is one to keep an eye out for. Since hooking up with the Dance Mania Legends, DJ Slugo and DJ Phats, Dr FMW found his true calling. A release on Slugo's label meant so much to the Doc and his pals (having grown up as Ghetto tech superfans). The journey has a lot left to run so with God's blessings, some more great music will be dropping in the months and years to come.\n\n**Stream** Dr FMW - \"in ur eyes\" on Spotify: [https://open.spotify.com/album/7bmoNp5PBFKyeNA4GzVPMB](https://open.spotify.com/album/7bmoNp5PBFKyeNA4GzVPMB)",

Hiii so I'm a experimental producer and I've just released my first song, is IDM/ambient, I've been wanting to release my music seriously for years, but I didn't feel confident enough for others to listen to it, however I decided to ignore the fear and release it. It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think! Thanks so much! Here's the link to the song on Spotify but it's on Apple Music, Deezer and almost all platforms too:\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/3porKsR3WhmOfJInQYXeK5](https://open.spotify.com/track/3porKsR3WhmOfJInQYXeK5)\n\n\n\nAnd my second song is already up exclusively to SoundCloud right now but going onto the other streaming services in like 15 days, here's the link:\n\n\n\n[https://soundcloud.com/kasprikkk/detached-stars-kasprikkk](https://soundcloud.com/kasprikkk/detached-stars-kasprikkk)",

Built by a [Publishing A&R](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittanyelperry/) who's worked at 2/3 largest music publishers as an A&R, this software was created to connect artists with incredible songwriters that their ear draws them to.\n\n  \nAI can copy sounds, but it can’t replace the soul that comes from a songwriter who’s lived it.  \n[GATELESS](http://www.g8less.com) is how Indie Artists fight back, level up, & **keep the future of music in the hands of actual creators.**  \nIf you’re serious about your career, **this is the back door** into the industry that was never meant to be open. Now you can grow key relationships **without getting wrapped in the** ***promise of creative connection***\\- on [GATELESS](http://www.g8less.com) you can pay to interact with songwriters you discover within the database.\n\nThe \"**connection fee**\" ranges from **$100-$1000** (depending on what the songwriter selects), but its there to provide an opportunity for writers **to earn a livable revenue** from their production & to show that **you're serious** (as an artist) in connecting with them.

It had a cool vibe, but we could not put it to words. In college, I kept coming back to it and eventually recorded a very rough demo about my experience in undergrad. It finally came together about a year ago after I met my now-wife, and this song became something whole.\n\nCheck it out on all major platforms: li.sten.to/northuptheavenue\n\nI only recently had the courage to share. \"North Up the Avenue\" is about growth, love, and nostalgia. Enjoy!",

Got a trance-y and vaguely retro self-release for everyone\n\n[Tikotch - Dichotomy Process (Spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/track/66iOOuhWy2r6hwOBbpln74?si=13bbcc535d7346f2)  \n[Tikotch - Dichotomy Process (Bandcamp)](https://tikotch.bandcamp.com/track/dichotomy-process-2)\n\nThis is the first solo track I've properly distributed and I'm really happy to say so. Being totally transparent, it is indicative of who I am, both being a perfectionist and an autistic person.

Hey everyone, I’m new here and I just wanted to share some of my music that I made. I hope plugging my music here is welcomed.\n\nOne day I woke up in a sleep paralysis where I was half awake but also dreaming. I wasn’t sure what time it was or how long l’ve been asleep. All I know at the time was how dark it was. I knew that I was on my bed in my room, but all I could see was this sort of distant, foreign, alien place where the sky was purple, there were mountains surrounding me and the scattered objects in my view looked familiar and obscure at the same time. And in the far distance, I heard music. I heard a guitar being ripped apart into shreds instead of being played. And percussions that weren’t recognisable yet familiar. I have been obsessed with making music that belongs in that world ever since.\n\n[Hazache - roma](https://soundcloud.com/hazache-396330669/sets/roma?ref=clipboard&p=i&c=1&si=0988B6A6D9F94F3EAA78D8AD63E51A40&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\n\nI made this completely by myself. Of course I would love to collaborate, but I have a lack of resources at the moment and just making the most of what I have.

It’s a story of overcoming obstacles, where the highs and lows become part of a fresh start, more mature and true. With its captivating rhythm, \"Amor Tonto\" is a true celebration of life, love, and the ability to begin again, stronger and more positively.\n\n**Will C** is a Brazilian singer who currently lives and works in Germany as a doctor. His passion for reggaeton began during his time in Argentina and later in Colombia, where he fell in love with the rhythm and energy of the genre. Since then, Will has been perfecting his skills in reggaeton, a style he is deeply passionate about. He enjoys singing in Spanish and feels a strong connection to the language, which makes him feel at ease when performing. Before releasing Amor Tonto, Will released two songs: BAiLAMOS SiN MiEDO and BERLiN, both of which reflect his evolving musical journey.\n\n**Stream** Will C - \"Amor Tonto\":\n\n* Spotify: [https://open.spotify.com/track/0uYtxhMi4eBplJ25jArJBn](https://open.spotify.com/track/0uYtxhMi4eBplJ25jArJBn)\n* YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_yO4MW\\_RdWo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yO4MW_RdWo)\n* SoundCloud: [https://soundcloud.com/will-c-315159786/amor-tonto](https://soundcloud.com/will-c-315159786/amor-tonto)",

The Postal Service - Such Great Heights\n\nVampire Weekend - Cousins\n\nSTRFKR - Rawnald Gregory Erickson the Second\n\nU2 - Where the Streets Have No Name",

Let me try again in a simpler way:\n\nI'm seeking high-energy, happy, uplifting, and groovy songs, preferably in the rock genre. I'm looking for music that is fun to listen to and dance to. I've searched through community playlists, YouTube music, and Spotify playlists but haven't found what I want, so I might not know the best terms to use.\n\nI prefer songs that aren't super popular or overplayed, but I'm open to including them if they fit the vibe. I'm unsure how to categorize the music I'm looking for— pop, rock, disco, or funk—but the main ideas are happy atmosphere and high energy.\n\nFeel free to suggest your own ideas, even if they're completely different from what I've described.
