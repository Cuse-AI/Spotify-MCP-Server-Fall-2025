      "full_context": "My Apple Music experience as a long term Spotify user. **Why I thought about switching**\n\nSo, I’ve been using Spotify for a couple of years and everything was fine. However, then they suddenly rise pricing. And even though it’s only one dollar and it seems there is no difference, there actually is. For example, I use family plan and for this pricing option it’s $3 rise. So in a year it’s a $36 difference. But I didn’t mind it and still continued using Spotify. And after another 6 months, maybe, a bit more there is the same price rise again. So, for my plan annually it’s $72 difference from the original price. Then, Apple releases this Liquid Glass update and out of curiosity eventually I downloaded the beta to try it out. I really liked the new UI and saw new Apple Music features, so I decided to finally give this program a shot.\n\n**Features I like in Apple Music**\n\nFirst of all, the design of Apple Music is amazing. I really like the design of apps made by Apple, so obviously I liked Apple Music. The Mac app is kind of worse than IOS/IPadOS versions, but I use it mainly on IOS, so it wasn’t a problem. And since Spotify is an electron app, Apple Music obviously wins on IOS, because of how great it’s optimized for this particular OS. I also enjoyed the lyrics feature so much, this feature’s design is amazing and way better than in Spotify. Also, I liked the replay playlists or top 100 in your country stuff in Apple Music, it’s kind of handy to be able to access such playlists easily and that they are updated frequently. The sound quality is amazing too. Even songs from totally unknown artists are level.\n\n**Features I miss from Spotify**\n\nWhat I miss from Spotify though is the sidebar. For example, I don’t need radio and a couple of other tabs in Apple Music, in Spotify there is home, search and library. Simple, easy and convenient. Another feature I miss is showing an amount of views in the top songs tab. It seems like a small thing, but I immediately notice it. Also, it’s probably the most controversial thing I’m going to say here, but I like music recommendations slightly more in Spotify. It suggests tracks from new artists I don’t know, but their music is very similar to the one I’m listening. Apple Music sometimes suggests something from the artists that I listen often to, but sometimes from artists I listened a long time ago, and that I don’t want to listen right now.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI made the switch to Apple Music, because of the pricing, design and sound quality. Yes, there are features I miss from Spotify, yes Apple Music has its limitations, yes Apple Music is the better choice obviously only on Apple platforms. With that being said, I don’t regret the switch, but totally understand those who use Spotify and in the end of the day, it’s more about preference and your specific needs, I just shared my experience in case it might help someone.\n\n**🎬 Video**\n\nI also made a video on my YouTube channel [AirTech](https://www.youtube.com/@AirTechnologyChannel) about this topic, where I compare in detail Spotify and Apple Music. There are some more examples and more details on specific features, performance and pricing of both apps. If you found this post useful, I think this video might be quite helpful for your research as well. Check it out [over here](https://youtu.be/nnGDTKe_fwI?si=meYBzPcgu-TdK_ij).. I've been using Apple Music for a while now after being a long-time Spotify user. I missed the recommendations and sometimes went back to check Spotify's Release Radar to find new releases that I'd like. Over time, and as I listened to more music, Apple Music's recommendations got better. I also favourited some artists so it would prioritise their new releases.\n\nI also like the Replay playlists and the human-curated genre and mood playlists. I just hope these don't get ruined by AI slop.\n\nOne of my pet peeves with Apple Music on the Mac is the some of the options like \"View in Library\", \"View in Apple Music\" or \"View in iTunes\" etc. I shouldn't have to care where the track/album is, just play the damn thing!\n\nOverall, I'm glad I moved. Though, it helps that my Apple Music subscription is bundled as a free add-on with my mobile phone plan.",

      "full_context": "My Apple Music experience as a long term Spotify user. **Why I thought about switching**\n\nSo, I’ve been using Spotify for a couple of years and everything was fine. However, then they suddenly rise pricing. And even though it’s only one dollar and it seems there is no difference, there actually is. For example, I use family plan and for this pricing option it’s $3 rise. So in a year it’s a $36 difference. But I didn’t mind it and still continued using Spotify. And after another 6 months, maybe, a bit more there is the same price rise again. So, for my plan annually it’s $72 difference from the original price. Then, Apple releases this Liquid Glass update and out of curiosity eventually I downloaded the beta to try it out. I really liked the new UI and saw new Apple Music features, so I decided to finally give this program a shot.\n\n**Features I like in Apple Music**\n\nFirst of all, the design of Apple Music is amazing. I really like the design of apps made by Apple, so obviously I liked Apple Music. The Mac app is kind of worse than IOS/IPadOS versions, but I use it mainly on IOS, so it wasn’t a problem. And since Spotify is an electron app, Apple Music obviously wins on IOS, because of how great it’s optimized for this particular OS. I also enjoyed the lyrics feature so much, this feature’s design is amazing and way better than in Spotify. Also, I liked the replay playlists or top 100 in your country stuff in Apple Music, it’s kind of handy to be able to access such playlists easily and that they are updated frequently. The sound quality is amazing too. Even songs from totally unknown artists are level.\n\n**Features I miss from Spotify**\n\nWhat I miss from Spotify though is the sidebar. For example, I don’t need radio and a couple of other tabs in Apple Music, in Spotify there is home, search and library. Simple, easy and convenient. Another feature I miss is showing an amount of views in the top songs tab. It seems like a small thing, but I immediately notice it. Also, it’s probably the most controversial thing I’m going to say here, but I like music recommendations slightly more in Spotify. It suggests tracks from new artists I don’t know, but their music is very similar to the one I’m listening. Apple Music sometimes suggests something from the artists that I listen often to, but sometimes from artists I listened a long time ago, and that I don’t want to listen right now.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI made the switch to Apple Music, because of the pricing, design and sound quality. Yes, there are features I miss from Spotify, yes Apple Music has its limitations, yes Apple Music is the better choice obviously only on Apple platforms. With that being said, I don’t regret the switch, but totally understand those who use Spotify and in the end of the day, it’s more about preference and your specific needs, I just shared my experience in case it might help someone.\n\n**🎬 Video**\n\nI also made a video on my YouTube channel [AirTech](https://www.youtube.com/@AirTechnologyChannel) about this topic, where I compare in detail Spotify and Apple Music. There are some more examples and more details on specific features, performance and pricing of both apps. If you found this post useful, I think this video might be quite helpful for your research as well. Check it out [over here](https://youtu.be/nnGDTKe_fwI?si=meYBzPcgu-TdK_ij).. I replied to someone deep down in this thread about this, but it might get missed by many. \n\nApple have quietly added more countries to the native tool to migrate your own playlists and songs from Spotify to AM. Tried it in the UK this week and it has worked well.\n\n\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/26/apple-music-transfer-tool-6-more-countries/\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/118249\n\nTransferring your library and playlists to Apple Music is available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.",

With all this AI music slop being generated, and with my choices being unaffected by it, I felt the urge to write my personal habits on listening. Also take note that I'm a young millenial who was raised on a developing country, so I came from a time and place where Internet wasn't ubiquitous to everyone's life.\n\n1) Try to listen to local musicians around you.\n\nI think it's easier than ever to know if a local musician or band is going to play. In the past, these events are announced only through word of mouth, radio, TV, and physical posters, but now you can use your social media to follow the accounts of places that allow local musicians to perform. These gigs are also usually cheap, and most local musicians are also easier to talk to. If they have some music in streaming services or CDs, you can listen to them or buy their merch.\n\n2) Talk to fellow music lovers and musicians.\n\nAnd listen to their recommendations. Particularly for musicians, some of us would geek out on our influences who happen to be actual people.\n\n3) If the Internet is your source, take time to research the artist who wrote the song that you like.\n\nIt gives you the advantage of verifying if they're real or AI. Plus, you can also listen to the whole album where the song you like is included, so you can immerse yourself better into that artist's discography. \n\n4) There are sites like Bandcamp who promote indie and famous artists alike.\n\n5) Go to music shops and/or secondhand thrift stores.\n\nYou can browse the CDs that they sell. Personally, what I do is for more established artists, I buy secondhand CDs (they come really really cheap) and for local and rising indie artists, I buy new (well, they can also come cheap). CDs not only have higher quality; they also have liner notes. Then I rip them for my personal use (I'm not a pirate) so I can listen to them on the go.\n\n6) Cherish the music that you have.\n\nSince I usually purchase CDs, I would prefer listening to them over other stuff. Probably the exception is jazz, because, while I do buy jazz albums, each live jazz performance is unique by itself due to arrangement, spontaneity of improvisations, and musicality of the instrumentalist. So I would also have playlists of live jazz performances in my YouTube channel. (Also, there's a lot of relatively not known but great jazz musicians all over the world, which performances are uploaded in YouTube).\n\nAnyway, these are my habits which allow me to listen to music made by real people. Also, this post is for people who dislike AI music slop. If  you're an AI music enjoyer or apologist, just stay out because you can't convince me or other people to listen to it.. yeah, I am with you on all these. \n\nI pay money to go see bands play live and most of the music I listen to is by young and/or touring bands.\n\n I buy physical media from the artists themselves first, from in-person retailers second, online retailers third. \n\nI've also bought a lot of digital media, it's stored on a local server so I can simulate a streaming sort of situation but it's all stuff I've purchased over the years.\n\nMy only real guilty pleasure is Spotify, but it tires me. It gets more and more like social media every day, have to tunnel my way through all of the stuff they deseperate want me to consume/experience just to get my library, and then continually adapt to the latest whack-a-mole games they play by changing the interface.

Most artists have done deals in which they're promised creative connection and the promisor falls significantly short, but has a vested % or financial interest in their career while the Artists' inspiration is limited by waiting on dated practices of exploring production-- learn from others & stay **INSPIRED**. Music is **NOT DEAD**, **it's waiting on you to take a chance with your career and find your production tribe on your own terms** :D !!\n\nFollow us for more advice on navigating and leveling up within the industry.\n\n[Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@gateless.co) | [Founder IG](https://www.instagram.com/britthomiequan/) | [Gateless(IG)](https://www.instagram.com/gateless.co/) | [Learn More on GATELESS](http://www.g8less.com)\n\n \n\n \n\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@gateless.co/video/7540756987131284791?is\\_from\\_webapp=1&sender\\_device=pc&web\\_id=7522654292227049015](https://www.tiktok.com/@gateless.co/video/7540756987131284791?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7522654292227049015)\n\n ",

And in the far distance, I heard music. I heard a guitar being ripped apart into shreds instead of being played. And percussions that weren’t recognisable yet familiar. I have been obsessed with making music that belongs in that world ever since.\n\n[Hazache - roma](https://soundcloud.com/hazache-396330669/sets/roma?ref=clipboard&p=i&c=1&si=0988B6A6D9F94F3EAA78D8AD63E51A40&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\n\nI made this completely by myself.

It's not widely known that the theme music for the original *Star Trek* had lyrics written by Gene Roddenberry. They're kind of... well, let's just say Roddenberry was not really a lyricist. But there are a few videos on YouTube of people singing those lyrics (among them Tenacious D and actor Robert Picardo).
