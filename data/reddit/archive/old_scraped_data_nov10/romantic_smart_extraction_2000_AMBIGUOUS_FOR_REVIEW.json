I am trying to make a playlist for myself about feeling disillusioned with love... not so much feel-better songs... more like, the feeling of having some innocence shed— I have been too naive, but now I have lost a lot of my optimism... maybe real love doesn't exist kind of.  Clearly... I have been deceived by someone I trusted. So... songs about trust/trust issues are great too.

      "full_context": "Leaving Spotify, Apple Music or Tidal?. Hey all, \n\nI am a current Spotify user but I’ve decided to leave them due to their awful extra curricular activities. I have Apply music for free (I’m an Apple user) and I have a free trial for Tidal.  I already have moved my playlists and songs to each app from Spotify. My most important features I look for are: \n\n• Recommending new music based on what I listen to\n\n• The app creating new mixes for me\n\n• A-release radar \n\n• Ensuring new music appears on the app at specific times (I.e. if a new album drops at midnight it will show on the app at midnight). \n\n I really love Spotify and its ease of use as well as quick the algorithm is in finding new music I like.\n\nBased on all this info can you give me your recommendations on which app to switch to between Apple Music or Tidal? Thanks! \n. It makes no actual sense to leave Spotify for their \"activities\" while typing from an iPhone or using Apple Music. \n\nApple's CEO donated $1,000,000 to the current administration, and literally gifted the current president a GOLD trophy.",

      "full_context": "Having a tough time listening to a complete song. I love trying to search for new music, but I never listen to the full song. I skip around to the chorus, figure out in 10 seconds if I like it, then add it to one of my many playlists. My problem is now I keep skipping around too much even with songs that I know I already love. I just find myself skipping to the best part, and then I move onto my next favorite song, listen to the best part, skip to my next favorite song just to hear the best part, etc, etc. I can do this for hours. I can go through a 100 of my favorite songs jumping between all the different genres just to \"remember\" what that song sounded like.  Maybe I'm just addicted to that little dopamine I get when I hear my favorite part. \n\n  \nDo any of you have this issue? I only have this issue when I'm using my laptop. I don't skip songs like this in the car or while I'm really focused in the office. I never skip when I'm listening to music with someone else too. How do y'all fix this bad habit. I've had this habit for years, it's nothing new, but lately I'm realizing maybe it's a bad thing. . I kind of do the same. Only difference is I sometimes will jump to the last minute of a song to see if there is a change in tempo. I listen to a lot of indie music as of late and a lot of bands that I listen to like to change tempo. Quick example,there is a song by starfucker called hotel New Jersey. I use to skip the song because I didn't like the start but it changes in the chorus and the end is even better. So yeah I'm weird like that too.",

I know this might be a hot button topic for some, but I've recently asked myself this question:\n\n  \nShould I separate the art from the artist? I know people have different answers for this question, but I'd like to know your thoughts on it. Among the artists whose art I've thought of separating from the person are the following:\n\n  \nDr. Luke - Yes, I know that what he did to Kesha was awful, and those who continue to work with him are likely desparate for a hit... but back in the 2000s and early 2010s, he produced quite a few bangers that I'd love to add to some playlists.\n\nKanye West - His love for a certain failed Austrian painter made people hate him as a person (including me), but if I could, I'd listen to his stuff up until The Life of Pablo.\n\nRyan Tedder - Considering certain events going on in the Middle East, Tedder is on the wrong side of it, but OneRepublic have had some pretty good songs in their discography that I'd love to rediscover.\n\nJared Leto - Sort of the same situation as Tedder, but everything 30STM did after 2013 is stuff I'd rather not touch.\n\nBackstreet Boys - Kind of like the last two, even though it's likely the management this time. Despite that, I'm kind of a sucker for their style of music.\n\n  \nIf this discussion isn't allowed, feel free to delete it. If not, what are you guys' thoughts on the topic of separating the art from the artists?. I'm a little confused by the purpose of this post.

      "full_context": "Your Top 4 Artists. Enough with Letterboxd and everyone’s top 4 movies; let’s discuss our top 4 Artists/Bands.\n\nList your top 4 Artists but for each state their general genre(s), a brief statement why they’re a fav of yours, your favorite album/EP and/or song by them, and a song/album that you would recommend to someone isn’t into or doesn’t know the artist.\n\nMy Top 4:\n\n1. Lady Gaga (Pop, Dance-pop). Her versatility is a force to be reckoned with; she’s gotten me to listen to and enjoy genres I normally wouldn’t be into or check out. She’s the total package; strong lyricist/songwriter, great producing ability, an amazing vocalist, trained musician, a skilled dancer, a refreshing and hypnotic persona and sense of style. And no one can do a music video like she does. If her artistry and music wasn’t enough, her strive and what she stands for make her iconic as well.\n\nFavorite Album = Born This Way, ARTPOP is close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Abracadabra, shows off the theatricality, strength, and versatility of her voice while exuding the weird and catchy lyricism that is part of her niche. And the production is immaculate and classic dance/synth Gaga.\n\nRecommended Album = ARTPOP or Mayhem, both are quintessential Gaga and have something for everybody on them.\n\n2. Young the Giant (Indie/Alternative Pop/Rock). They literally can’t make a bad song. The lead singer has the voice of an angel and it’s unique. Their melodies, production, and lyrics are a mood and matched with Sameer’s heavenly vocals, they entrance you. And with a signature style/sound all their albums sound different and have different sonic elements and themes.\n\nFavorite Album = Home of the Strange, Mirror Master is a close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Call Me Back, shows off Sameer’s vocals and exemplifies their sound/style and lyrical content.\n\nRecommended Album = Home of the Strange, a perfect showcase of their sound, their lyrical themes, and Sameer’s vocals. Has many of their best songs and music videos.\n\n3. Kid Cudi (Alternative Hip-hop, Melodic Rap). His music has great and addictive atmosphere and he really knows how to create a wonderful vibe through melodic beats, introspective and cosmic/spiritual lyrics, and his unique and eclectic vocal stylings and performance. He’s in a league of his own and that has made he so influential and so resonating.\n\nFavorite Album = Man On the Moon III: The Chosen\n\nRecommended Song = Just What I Am, the hypnotic and atmospheric melody and production he is known for, paired with his central lyrical themes and signature vocals/flow.\n\nRecommended Album = Man on the Moon series (1, 2, or 3), the trilogy best represents him and has most of his best and iconic work.\n\n4. Majid Jordan (Alternative R&B, Synthwave/pop). They make magic together. Deep bouncy and raving production, serenading soulful and emotional vocals, and decadent romantic lyrics; they’re a perfect R&B duo. They move me with their music in multiple ways lol.\n\nFavorite Album = Wildest Dreams\n\nRecommended Song = Something About You, classic Majid Jordan. Emotive and strong vocals from Majid, minimalistic but enchanting production from Jordan, and their signature affectionate lyrics. \n\nRecommended Album = A Place Like This - EP or Wildest Dreams, both are essential Majid Jordan and prominent work in their discography.. Michael Jackson \n- I’ve listened to Michael Jackson ever since I could hear rhythm and has been my foundation for finding out what I like \n- Bad or Dangerous can’t choose \n- I’d recommend Bad. Has the most hits and is very diverse.\n\nPrince\n- I started to listen to Prince about a year ago and now know a lot of his music. He has helped me embrace who I am and has such a unique sound\n- Purple Rain, Sign o The Times is close\n- Again I would recommend Purple Rain. The title track is imo the greatest song of all time every song is a hit. \n\nMetallica\n- Bit of a weird one according to my top 2 but I love them. Started listening to them about a year and a half ish years ago. They were introduction into harsh rock and metal. I love their guitar and got me into playing guitar myself.\n- …and Justice for All is my fav\n- If you are looking for something faster, more thrash, high screaming vocals I’d recommend ride the lightning or master of puppets. If you want heavier, slower or melodic and heavier/deeper vocals then the black album without a doubt\n\nThese are the only artists and bands I adore or just really know a lot about so just three ig 😂",

Has the most hits and is very diverse.\n\nPrince\n- I started to listen to Prince about a year ago and now know a lot of his music. He has helped me embrace who I am and has such a unique sound\n- Purple Rain, Sign o The Times is close\n- Again I would recommend Purple Rain. The title track is imo the greatest song of all time every song is a hit. \n\nMetallica\n- Bit of a weird one according to my top 2 but I love them. Started listening to them about a year and a half ish years ago. They were introduction into harsh rock and metal. I love their guitar and got me into playing guitar myself.\n- …and Justice for All is my fav\n- If you are looking for something faster, more thrash, high screaming vocals I’d recommend ride the lightning or master of puppets. If you want heavier, slower or melodic and heavier/deeper vocals then the black album without a doubt\n\nThese are the only artists and bands I adore or just really know a lot about so just three ig 😂",

      "full_context": "Your Top 4 Artists. Enough with Letterboxd and everyone’s top 4 movies; let’s discuss our top 4 Artists/Bands.\n\nList your top 4 Artists but for each state their general genre(s), a brief statement why they’re a fav of yours, your favorite album/EP and/or song by them, and a song/album that you would recommend to someone isn’t into or doesn’t know the artist.\n\nMy Top 4:\n\n1. Lady Gaga (Pop, Dance-pop). Her versatility is a force to be reckoned with; she’s gotten me to listen to and enjoy genres I normally wouldn’t be into or check out. She’s the total package; strong lyricist/songwriter, great producing ability, an amazing vocalist, trained musician, a skilled dancer, a refreshing and hypnotic persona and sense of style. And no one can do a music video like she does. If her artistry and music wasn’t enough, her strive and what she stands for make her iconic as well.\n\nFavorite Album = Born This Way, ARTPOP is close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Abracadabra, shows off the theatricality, strength, and versatility of her voice while exuding the weird and catchy lyricism that is part of her niche. And the production is immaculate and classic dance/synth Gaga.\n\nRecommended Album = ARTPOP or Mayhem, both are quintessential Gaga and have something for everybody on them.\n\n2. Young the Giant (Indie/Alternative Pop/Rock). They literally can’t make a bad song. The lead singer has the voice of an angel and it’s unique. Their melodies, production, and lyrics are a mood and matched with Sameer’s heavenly vocals, they entrance you. And with a signature style/sound all their albums sound different and have different sonic elements and themes.\n\nFavorite Album = Home of the Strange, Mirror Master is a close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Call Me Back, shows off Sameer’s vocals and exemplifies their sound/style and lyrical content.\n\nRecommended Album = Home of the Strange, a perfect showcase of their sound, their lyrical themes, and Sameer’s vocals. Has many of their best songs and music videos.\n\n3. Kid Cudi (Alternative Hip-hop, Melodic Rap). His music has great and addictive atmosphere and he really knows how to create a wonderful vibe through melodic beats, introspective and cosmic/spiritual lyrics, and his unique and eclectic vocal stylings and performance. He’s in a league of his own and that has made he so influential and so resonating.\n\nFavorite Album = Man On the Moon III: The Chosen\n\nRecommended Song = Just What I Am, the hypnotic and atmospheric melody and production he is known for, paired with his central lyrical themes and signature vocals/flow.\n\nRecommended Album = Man on the Moon series (1, 2, or 3), the trilogy best represents him and has most of his best and iconic work.\n\n4. Majid Jordan (Alternative R&B, Synthwave/pop). They make magic together. Deep bouncy and raving production, serenading soulful and emotional vocals, and decadent romantic lyrics; they’re a perfect R&B duo. They move me with their music in multiple ways lol.\n\nFavorite Album = Wildest Dreams\n\nRecommended Song = Something About You, classic Majid Jordan. Emotive and strong vocals from Majid, minimalistic but enchanting production from Jordan, and their signature affectionate lyrics. \n\nRecommended Album = A Place Like This - EP or Wildest Dreams, both are essential Majid Jordan and prominent work in their discography.. Michael Jackson \n- I’ve listened to Michael Jackson ever since I could hear rhythm and has been my foundation for finding out what I like \n- Bad or Dangerous can’t choose \n- I’d recommend Bad. Has the most hits and is very diverse.\n\nPrince\n- I started to listen to Prince about a year ago and now know a lot of his music. He has helped me embrace who I am and has such a unique sound\n- Purple Rain, Sign o The Times is close\n- Again I would recommend Purple Rain.

If you want heavier, slower or melodic and heavier/deeper vocals then the black album without a doubt\n\nThese are the only artists and bands I adore or just really know a lot about so just three ig 😂",
