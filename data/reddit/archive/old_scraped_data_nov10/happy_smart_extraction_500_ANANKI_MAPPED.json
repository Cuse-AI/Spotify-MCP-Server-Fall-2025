      "full_context": "Lost my mom to cancer almost 3 months ago, and the holiday season is becoming unbearable. Music is my favorite form of therapy. What are some good songs about losing a mother to cancer? . My mom lost her battle to cancer, and passed away September 26th this year. She was diagnosed in June so it was a very fast decline. I’ve been grieving since, but the holiday season is really compounding the grief lately. All of the happy memories make me cry. \n\nI love music, and I worked in the music industry professionally for 10+ years so it’s what resonates with me most to really feel things deeply. I’ve been listening to some of my mom’s favorites since she passed. \n\nI’m looking for some new music suggestions that are specially about losing a mother to cancer. Just listening to emotional music, and crying has been helpful towards the grief for whatever reason. \n\nThank you in advance for any suggestions!. I lost my mum to cancer August 2024 sharing my playlist below for you, hope it helps 🤍\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/4G2GxQrgk9wBtSxnKVHh29?si=KKYJ7YQfQV2JXvUYHaYMsg&pi=e-MxPH_-YGSUqJ",
