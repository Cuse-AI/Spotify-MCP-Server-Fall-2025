      "comment_text": "Oh, Tom. You gave me so many lovely memories.\n\nI was an actor at UC Santa Cruz in the 80s. Tom taught math half the year at Harvard and half the year at UCSC, with an extra musical theater class for us in the Spring.\n\nI was in a show that he came to see, and afterwards mutual friends told me he liked my performance and wanted me to audition for his class. I'm not much of a singer but you just don't say no to this kind of opportunity.\n\nThey were open auditions with a hundred hyperventilating college kids and Tom on the piano. He could sightread anything. I did my best Mack the Knife and I was in. The class was incredibly intense. UCSC is on quarters, I think 10 weeks each? We performed 8 musicals in those 10 weeks to huge crowds, script in hand.\n\nHe started us with Gilbert & Sullivan then up through operetta to Vaudeville, tin pan alley, then the golden age of American musicals into the 60s. He had no use for anything after that, despised Andrew Lloyd Webber, and was proudest of the fact in his life that he had once shared a cabin as like an 8 year old camp kid with Stephen Sondheim, whom he worshipped. Okay, I guess Sondheim was to him the only worthwhile modern creator of musicals. But this was the 80s and I don't know if he ever found anyone else to admire.\n\nI recall we did Pal Joey and the Music Man but one of my greatest moments on stage my entire career was playing the MC in Cabaret with Tom fucking Lehrer as my backing musician. It was utterly magical. And then I introduced him to my parents and for the first time in my life I saw them truly starstruck and they allowed that maybe I could make something of this acting hobby. I was in heaven. Nowhere to go from there but down lol.\n\nI recall him extolling Sondheim to us once, telling us that he only ever used perfect rhymes instead of cheap homophones, and he lost the love of about half the class when he said the worst offender of this was Stevie Wonder, who had just come out with \"I Just Called To Say I Love You.\" Tom whined it out in a mocking tone, emphasizing the sloppy line ends and puerile sentimentality. That dark edge from his songs was who he was. He couldn't help but slash at the world. But it was because he loved beautiful things so much and he hated to see them ruined.\n\nI think the last time I saw him was the end of that semester. I went over to his condo in faculty housing. I was producing my own play and it began with a man trapped in a small cage singing both parts of the duet All For The Best from Godspell, which becomes manic gibberish by the end. We sat at the keyboard and worked out the switches and had a wonderful time. I loved that he treated me as an equal. I've prized no man's esteem as much. RIP."

My current practice with music is to impose a set of creative restrictions on my work for a period of 2 - 6 weeks and create a few (hopefully different) pieces of music that line up with each set of restrictions.\n\nThis one had to feature at least one continuous musical drone and had to have at least something of a sinister vibe. I’d love to hear your thoughts."

It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think! Thanks so much! Here's the link to the song on Spotify but it's on Apple Music, Deezer and almost all platforms too:\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/3porKsR3WhmOfJInQYXeK5](https://open.spotify.com/track/3porKsR3WhmOfJInQYXeK5)\n\n\n\nAnd my second song is already up exclusively to SoundCloud right now but going onto the other streaming services in like 15 days, here's the link:\n\n\n\n[https://soundcloud.com/kasprikkk/detached-stars-kasprikkk](https://soundcloud.com/kasprikkk/detached-stars-kasprikkk)"

I only discovered them through random Instagram & TikTok reels and I instantly got hooked and became one of their new fans. This band will definitely take you back again to that 2000's MySpace era w/ their music. They just got that original & classic pop-punk sound and I would like to help them out to blow up somehow just to show my support to the band because this type of sound is one of the sounds we also need to hear in this modern times.\n\nFFO: Simple Plan, State Champs, The Paradox\n\nWATCH Here:\nhttps://youtu.be/Emy66y07MHk\n\nSTREAM Here: https://open.spotify.com/track/6yXekOrMatOvZ9cCAROrvu"

This track blends sharp verses with a hard-hitting chorus to tell the story of someone who’s changed so much they’re no longer recognizable to the person reaching out. It’s about breaking free from old versions of yourself, cutting ties with ghosts, and stepping fully into who you’ve become.\n\nAppreciate any/all feedback!"

Performed entirely live with real instruments —ronroco and bowed strings, featuring rumbling, husky basses and cello— it captures the natural richness of a centuries-old room with nothing more than wood, strings, and two carefully placed microphones. Purely acoustic: fingers, breath, and space.\nBittersweet and in a minor key, the piece moves through a melancholic landscape before opening into a luminous major coda.\n\nThanks for listening, cheers DD"

The improvisation, the groove, the soul... it’s a language all its own. I honestly feel like every note tells a story, not just from the performer, but from the entire lineage of jazz history.\n\nLately, I’ve been trying to channel that inspiration into my own little creative space. I recently made a video (linked below) not just to play, but to *honor* the sound that’s given me so much joy. I tried to pour real love into every second of it. It's not perfect, but it's from the heart.\n\nIf you’re a fellow jazz lover, or just curious to hear someone explore that space, I’d be humbled if you gave it a listen. And more importantly—drop your favorite jazz artists below! I’m always looking to expand my listening.\n\n  \nPMP – Take Five | 60s Jazz Revival | 4K  \nHere’s the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKLPp2R1c9I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKLPp2R1c9I)  \nThanks for letting me share. Keep the jazz alive. ✨"

It had a cool vibe, but we could not put it to words. In college, I kept coming back to it and eventually recorded a very rough demo about my experience in undergrad. It finally came together about a year ago after I met my now-wife, and this song became something whole.\n\nCheck it out on all major platforms: li.sten.to/northuptheavenue\n\nI only recently had the courage to share. \"North Up the Avenue\" is about growth, love, and nostalgia.

One day in the big boxes that we would sort through one of us had a vintage Christmas doll that sang \"silent night\" in a child's voice buried deep in the box and we couldn't figure out where it was coming from which gave us an eerie feeling. This song aims to recreate that feeling. Heavily inspired by Memphis rap // Memphis Revival.\n\nReleasing on all platforms soon [https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/zourd/svlxnt-nvght-silent-night?utm\\_campaign=website&utm\\_medium=Email+&utm\\_source=SendGrid](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/zourd/svlxnt-nvght-silent-night?utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=Email+&utm_source=SendGrid)"

Bloomfield Machine -- \"Copium\" Electronica \\[2025\\]  I’m a solo electronic rock artist going under the name Bloomfield Machine.  My 8th album—Copium— just dropped on Bandcamp.  The music is short bursts of melodic instrumental works that can be described as downtempo, ambient, lo-fi, psychedelic, dystopian, cinematic.  I’d be honored for you to take a listen. Headphones give the best experience. I create all the music using Reason as my DAW. Lots of plug ins and some guitars/basses here in my studio.

Every OST he made is very unique, I recommend you to take a listen to different works, some are more electronic, others more soft and piano-focused. \nOccultic;Nine is one of the OSTs more similar to Death Note's that I know of, is one of my fav works he did\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/4wtqTu3La9UiTlL9bgaYTY?si=fXoosM3ZTp-4Wnpo52Xfdw\n\nI usually look for other work from the same composer in the same medium. I looked up other anime soundtracks by the two DN composers, and it turns out there's some of them I like and didn't know it was theirs! Like Midori no Hibi (Midori Days)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihisa_Hirano\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Taniuchi\n\nYou can try soundtracks to suspense and mystery visual novels. Deep bass + chill beats everywhere. I suggest you try the music from the Zero Escape series. Here's my favourite one from the second game, I really think it's close what you've looking for:\nhttps://youtu.be/GJvZwZQV7fs\n\nBoogiepop wa Warawanai! The whole soundtrack is a treat to listen to with good headphones. It was my go-to music too work and study to for two years straight.\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2u8FEioqRhj2p8UXKNIN2V?si=DMZIv7o_SNy0Vko_3bzFaw\n\nSome good artists with songs you may like outside the realm of soundtracks\n\nNew Order - Elegia\nhttps://youtu.be/omzJvwYO440\n\nThe National - About Today\nhttps://youtu.be/Ipx8qWt2fVA\n\nSkeleten - Bodys Chorus \nhttps://youtu.be/CVxBrU8iYOM\n\n[Long shot!]\nTelevision - The Dream's Dream\nhttps://youtu.be/ihtlGB8zI9s\n\n[Long shot!]\nPublic Image Ltd - Poptones\nhttps://youtu.be/IQtO6R4qkg0\n\nWhew, that's all I can think of right now, I really hope it helps you find what you want!"
