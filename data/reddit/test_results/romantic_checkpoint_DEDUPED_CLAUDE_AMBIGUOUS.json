The human requested '70s and 80s ballad love songs' and recommended 'Cathy Dennis - Too Many Walls' (a 1990 pop ballad). However, Spotify validated this as 'Redman - I Don't Kare' which is a hip-hop track that doesn't match the romantic ballad context at all. The recommendation context suggests a romantic ballad vibe (like 'Romantic - Slow Dance' or 'Sad - Heartbreak'), but the actual validated song is by Redman, a hip-hop artist known for energetic rap tracks, making it impossible to confidently map the human's emotional intent to the actual song without hearing it.

From Millennium onward, they had a good amount of bangers, even into that period in the later half of the 2000s when they tried to be more mature.\n\nAs for your other non-Kanye points...\n\nJohn Lennon may have been a terrible husband and father, but there's some good stuff there. Imagine may be cheesy af, but I can see why people like it.\n\nGary Glitter, though... I cringe when I click on a video for old hockey goal horns from the 90s and 00s, and the song is fucking Rock and Roll Pt. II. I wish to never hear that stupid tune ever again.",

It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think!

However, the Spotify-validated song is by Los Campesinos! ('I Just Sighed. I Just Sighed, Just So You Know'), which doesn't match the artist mentioned in the comment.

Car Seat Headrest (indie rock, slacker rock)\n\nFavorite album (and my favorite album of all time): How To Leave Town, I just think it's their most ambitious and relatable project\n\nRecommended album: Twin Fantasy (Face to Face), most CSH fans who got into the band after 2018 started with this album, most people consider it their magnum opus, the songwriting is extremely personal and heartbreaking at times (especially on the last 3 songs), if someone wants to check out 1 song I recommend Beach Life-In-Death, it's just iconic\n\n2. Swans (post-rock, experimental rock)\n\nFavorite album: To Be Kind, it's their most consistent album front to back, every song is an experience on its own and together they make something unforgettable, whether you like this album or not, I doubt it'll leave you indifferent\n\nRecommended album: White Light from the Mouth of Infinity, it's one of their most accessible works but still one of their strongest, I think Blind is one of the most beautifully written songs in their discography so I would start with that song\n\n3. Weatherday (noise pop, emo)\n\nFavorite album: both of them, Hornet Disaster and Come In are equally fantastic, great riffs, passionate performances, interesting songwriting and it's all noisy and I love when music is noisy\n\nRecommended album: Come In, purely because it's the first one and it's shorter, My Sputnik Sweetheart is a song I'd recommend from this album, it's a 12 minute emotional rollecoaster and it basically has everything Weatherday offers\n\n4. AJJ (folk punk, indie rock)\n\nFavorite album: Knife Man, it's a little messy but it's filled with fun and memorable songs that will make you laugh at how fucked we are, plus Big Bird is such a beautiful song, it's very different from their other songs but it's a perfect closer for an album like Knife Man\n\nRecommended album: People Who Eat People Are The Luckiest People In The World, this album is the perfect representation of AJJ's sound, it's probably their most cohesive record and has their best songwriting",

      "ananki_reasoning": "There is a clear mismatch between the context and the song. The human's comment discusses discovering indie/alternative rock and new wave songs from soundtracks (The Church, Echo & the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears, The Shins, The Dead Texan, Damien Jurado - all atmospheric, introspective artists), but the validated Spotify song is 'Head Banger' by EPMD, which is a classic hip-hop track. This appears to be either a data error or the wrong song was matched to this context. Since the song doesn't align with the emotional context provided (soundtrack discovery of moody alternative tracks), I cannot accurately assign a sub-vibe.",

The comment provides no emotional context about Akhenaton's song, making it impossible to accurately map the emotional intent for this specific track.",
