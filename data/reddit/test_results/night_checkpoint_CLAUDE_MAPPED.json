      "ananki_reasoning": "The human explicitly frames this as music for 'stargazing when you're tired but want the vibes.' Stargazing is inherently a nighttime, contemplative activity that involves looking upward at the cosmos, reflecting, and experiencing a sense of wonder while in a relaxed, tired state. The references to King Crimson's 'Islands' (a dreamy progressive rock piece) and 'It's Not Night: It's Space' (literally describing the cosmic/space atmosphere) reinforce the celestial, contemplative nighttime mood. This isn't about driving or sleeping, but rather about being awake enough to experience the atmosphere while tired—a perfect match for contemplative nighttime listening while observing the stars.",
