      "comment_text": "'79 here. It's been a wild ride.\n\nMonopolistic corporatization of the industry have killed most of the radio and a lot of venues for music.  This killed a lot of interest from listeners. And there has also been soooo much music recorded that one could listen to music constantly and never hear the same thing twice over several lifetimes. It may take me the rest of my life just to get Thru [Fela Kuti](https://youtu.be/q2E32KsPWhs?si=04FaSoCW0gOMD7-X)'s catalog.\n\nHowever technology has always disrupted the music industry and continues to do so. The barrier for entry of the musician to \"release\" music has not ever been lower.  [Steve Lacy](https://youtu.be/x-OzspEcQG8?si=a74xK3FMQI8UbHFn) made his \"Steve Lacy's Demo\" EP using just a phone and a couple instruments, nearly 10 years ago. His [TED talk](https://youtu.be/SUnmrQfdYpg?si=eNB4sCEhMkVqB0Ce) shows that you shouldn't let lack of fancy stuff stop you. The new technology means that more *good* new music is being produced now than at any time ever, and in all genre.  It can be overwhelming to navigate an ocean of new and old music.\n\nThat change isn't all sunshine and roses.  The fall of the recording studio proper also carries with it some loss in production knowledge.  A lot of new things aren't as \"slick\" sounding as older releases.  But the music is strong.\n\n[Folk](https://youtu.be/TCsFgJsJ5Uc?si=X8XJjfy9RZcBt6dJ) and [jazz]( https://youtu.be/fsjC8xYW9l8?si=kG-D3XmD5j8VnzAa) are each on fire right now. Throwback Bossa Nova artist [Pedro Mizutani](https://youtu.be/eXAUrGi4s7o?si=uuFphb3hrToYFs40) can tour Europe performing, powered by TikTok views.  \n\nOne that very strongly resonated for me is [Ginger Root](https://youtu.be/PiOdGpR0TdU?si=ZlhxJ5clfqzBsGk3)'s album from last year, *Shinbangumi*, blending Japanese City Pop with throwback 1980s television aesthetics and great storytelling.  The throwback aesthetic that he's mastered is deceptive.  This simply could not have existed before the decade we are living in."

I find so much good new music by participating in these threads and listening to what others recommend.\n\nHere is yet another (for when you have time): [Bel Canto - The Suffering](https://youtu.be/Ik4GuD7aZ-M?list=OLAK5uy_mUZs3ubaX1NNItAXyrCHxUEwQNclOjTFM) The singer, Anneli Drecker is one of my favorites. She uses her voice very expressively to evoke longing. Another in that direction is [Without You](https://youtu.be/llRW86iUmi0?list=OLAK5uy_kasxGTq7NGoxiNyPC-f4uOPjJLUffaFPw) where you can just feel the rejection and emptiness she sings of. Again goosebumps. My favorite song by her is a very dreamy ballad in German called [Ladonia](https://youtu.be/1ZD_L6MXIXY?list=OLAK5uy_kCchlyv2-4yPsRTbNaimg_eGKWxtZzmyo). It is again romantic longing for someone she can only dream about being with... the song ends on an exhale that really gets to me."

Even if they're playing mellower music from the 90s it wouldn't have that effect on your generation and a lot of older Gen-X folks.  Twenty years ago it probably would've been more 1950s music, but in another decade or two they'll probably shift forward to more 80s & 90s music."

I really do like the spatial audio and lossless which I get at no extra cost, also the apple ecosystem integration since most of my devices are apple. But here's what I miss, would be open to suggestions on how people here have overcome this,  \n1. Spotify connect  \n2. User generated playlists - I would search for a genre or vibe, and there would be so many fun curated playlists by random people, apple music doesn't have that at all  \n3. Multiple auto generated playlists based on mood and vibe  \n4. Worse desktop app"

Blending raw emotion with haunting vulnerability, it captures the thrill, guilt, and self-destruction that come with loving someone you know will ruin you. Exploring heavy and powerful guitars combined with soft and ambient vocals. Perfect for playlists that explore toxic love, late-night reflection, and emotional unraveling."

That's why I want to be upfront about the process and how I use it:\n\n* My lyrics are purely mine. My thoughts, my stories, and my personal experiences are the absolute starting point. I also compose all melodies on the piano first.\n* I use AI not as a ghostwriter, but as a powerful tool for rapid experimentation and sound design. Using tools like Suno Studio for rapid stem manipulation, I can instantly audition my core piano melody across dozens of instrumentations and genres. This allows me to explore and commit to a final arrangement much faster than I could using traditional software, without having to manually score or re-record every part. I guide and direct every step.\n* After the AI helps me explore and choose the best direction, I spend extensive time editing, mixing, and fine-tuning to ensure the track retains the emotional weight and personal touch of the original melody.\n\nMy goal is to take something fundamentally human and amplify its impact through technology, creating tracks that are personal, immersive, but uniquely a product of my own direction - I'm hoping that stands out with my songs. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on this process (and I promise the word \"neon\" will never show up in any of my music).\n\nAlso, any feedback on the above track from my Soundcloud would always be appreciated!"

It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think! Thanks so much!

This track blends sharp verses with a hard-hitting chorus to tell the story of someone who’s changed so much they’re no longer recognizable to the person reaching out.
