She uses her voice very expressively to evoke longing. Another in that direction is [Without You](https://youtu.be/llRW86iUmi0?list=OLAK5uy_kasxGTq7NGoxiNyPC-f4uOPjJLUffaFPw) where you can just feel the rejection and emptiness she sings of. Again goosebumps. My favorite song by her is a very dreamy ballad in German called [Ladonia](https://youtu.be/1ZD_L6MXIXY?list=OLAK5uy_kCchlyv2-4yPsRTbNaimg_eGKWxtZzmyo). It is again romantic longing for someone she can only dream about being with... the song ends on an exhale that really gets to me."

      "comment_text": "If the restaurants and pubs you're talking about are corporate chains then they probably don't have much choice as the music played is approved by the same people who approve the logo and branding, the decor, the nicknames of food on the menu and so forth.\n\nThat music will be familiar and comfortable to any age demographic and provide almost a subliminal appeal even if you don't particularly notice the music playing.  Even if they're playing mellower music from the 90s it wouldn't have that effect on your generation and a lot of older Gen-X folks.  Twenty years ago it probably would've been more 1950s music, but in another decade or two they'll probably shift forward to more 80s & 90s music."

      "comment_text": "**DJ Slugo’s “A Blunt (Dr FMW Remix)” injects raw, rave-hardened energy into the original with a fierce blend of ghetto house, grime, and UK bass.** Irish-born Dr FMW draws on decades of underground experience to deliver a remix that's both unapologetically gritty and dancefloor-ready.\n\n**About Dr FMW:** Irish born Dr FMW aka DOCTAH has been heavily involved in music for over 20 years. He started off as a young rave slave traveling round the UK and Europe to see US techno legends like Rob Hood Ben Sims and Derrick May. In the 2010s in Manchester, England, Dubstep/Grime was new and blowing up. Raves like Sequence and Hit & Run were legendary and left a lasting impact on the artist. \"I only like raw music with attitude.\" Living with 7 friends, heavily involved in making music/DJing, then eventually putting on huge shows like Drum Clinic and Warehouse Project events in Manchester, Dr FMW certainly benefited from a stellar musical education (and received more than a few noise complaints along the way). He now produced Dubstep Grime UK Garage, Jungle and Ghetto House.\n\nIt is only in the past few years the Doc fell in love with producing after regularly being asked for advice by friends who were making music at the time. Something clicked. Starting in 2023, after teaching himself the ropes, there were quite a few label releases on various labels/genres (Dakrheart/MOR). Despite his inexperience, Juno picked out \"Hollow Head\" as one of their favorite dubstep tracks of the year in 2023, ahead of acts like Hamdi. As a member of a collective called \"E-180\" with some incredible artists across Europe and beyond, there has been lots cooking including an upcoming compilation coming soon, which is one to keep an eye out for. Since hooking up with the Dance Mania Legends, DJ Slugo and DJ Phats, Dr FMW found his true calling. A release on Slugo's label meant so much to the Doc and his pals (having grown up as Ghetto tech superfans). The journey has a lot left to run so with God's blessings, some more great music will be dropping in the months and years to come.\n\n**Stream** DJ Slugo - A Blunt (Dr FMW Remix) on Spotify: [https://open.spotify.com/track/4rJvWjO6tSXgYYsBOIQcMt](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rJvWjO6tSXgYYsBOIQcMt)"

Our studio time over the weekend resulted in 5 more cover songs added to our ever-increasing repertoire. We are finding covers of some artists more challenging than others but that's part of the fun. As usual we like to try and record in one take with no multi tracking and minimal technological assistance. If you get a chance to listen to our latest few don't forget we are always happy to receive feedback good or bad.

With soaring melodies, multilingual choral textures, and themes of unity and peace, the piece resonates as both a spiritual and cultural statement.**\n\nArnaud Fillion’s “Kune” (meaning “Together” in Esperanto) is a visionary symphonic work created for peace and cultural unification. Composed for symphony orchestra, multi-language choir, and soloists, “Kune” consists of 11 movements that weave together around 50 different languages to convey universal themes such as fraternity, empathy, respect beyond differences, and ecological awareness. This “symphony for peace” is more than just a musical piece—it is a collaborative human project, having involved nearly one hundred volunteers, translators, and cultural intermediaries in the writing process. Each text was carefully recorded as a phonetic reference to ensure authenticity and accessibility for the performers. The album was recorded in October 2023 in Lviv, Ukraine, featuring the Lviv National Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra and the “Gloria” Chamber Choir under the direction of Serhiy Khorovets.\n\n**Stream** Arnaud Fillion - \"Kune\" (performed by the Lviv National Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, Lviv Chamber choir Gloria, Serhiy Khorovets):\n\n* Spotify: [https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/album/3bqU1O2YSA8hKezpqY91iV](https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/album/3bqU1O2YSA8hKezpqY91iV)\n* YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy\\_m11khB-aEDXrwi-9oUQLyFX28cyP4h9ek](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m11khB-aEDXrwi-9oUQLyFX28cyP4h9ek)\n* Amazon Music: [https://music.amazon.fr/albums/B0D3FL6LW1](https://music.amazon.fr/albums/B0D3FL6LW1)\n* Deezer: [https://www.deezer.com/fr/album/582966632](https://www.deezer.com/fr/album/582966632)\n* Other Streaming Platforms: [https://li.sten.to/kune](https://li.sten.to/kune)"

This is \"Leave\".\n\nIt’s about those final moments in a relationship — when love turns quiet, but the weight of unspoken goodbyes hangs heavy. I recorded it last year and just released it on Spotify a few days ago. It’s acoustic-driven, emotional, and has a bit of that U2 and Bon Jovi influence that shaped my sound.\n\n🎧 **Spotify link**: [https://spoti.fi/43kywMw](https://spoti.fi/43kywMw?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExRUd2amFDZ1h3amo5RzRhaQEe1SkY23oDZj-P3axn2NvqptkIbdtZHoYnq8jXc9Cd4utJaG2T5_1X7CP1Ef8_aem_9EYLWkP2NhekF8A-aDlK9g)\n\n🎧 **Apple Music link**: [https://apple.co/4dG5jPq](https://apple.co/4dG5jPq)\n\n🎧 **YouTube Lyric Video link**: [https://youtu.be/czJ0Q-bOsQ0?si=Et60bUxI1YvM093C](https://youtu.be/czJ0Q-bOsQ0?si=Et60bUxI1YvM093C)\n\n💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts — especially if the lyrics or mood hit you in any way.

It made me cry.\n\nThen, a few months after she passed away, I met a guy. We were friends for a couple years, then ended up dating for one. For some reason, that was our song. It would still make me happy cry because I appreciated him so much. \n\nThen, out of nowhere, he left over text, offered next to no explanation, and ghosted me forever afterwards. Hearing it now just makes me angry at myself for supposedly messing things up, him for doing that, and what I feel could have been in the future."
