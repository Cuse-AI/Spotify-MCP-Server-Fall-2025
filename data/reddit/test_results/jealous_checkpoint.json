Sublime were a mix of SO many influences. They were true lovers of music and loved sharing music by incorporating little bits and pieces from all over. \n[Sublimes - 40 oz to Freedom Samples, Covers, and Influence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPyTzpXaZuQ)  \n\nFor just a band that I think sounds a lot like Sublime, Fishbone was doing a very similar mixture of punk, funk, and ska. \n\n[Party at Ground Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwX0fkGf5rA)   \n[Ma and Pa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK640dPPhXE)  \n[It's a Wonderful Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFXxTzFriTk)   \n\nGo back a little earlier to the Specials, too, for the birth of the ska/punk crossover with the British Two-Tone movement. \n\n[Message to You Rudy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntvEDbagAw)  \n[Gangsters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgCZN1rU5co)"

She uses her voice very expressively to evoke longing. Another in that direction is [Without You](https://youtu.be/llRW86iUmi0?list=OLAK5uy_kasxGTq7NGoxiNyPC-f4uOPjJLUffaFPw) where you can just feel the rejection and emptiness she sings of. Again goosebumps. My favorite song by her is a very dreamy ballad in German called [Ladonia](https://youtu.be/1ZD_L6MXIXY?list=OLAK5uy_kCchlyv2-4yPsRTbNaimg_eGKWxtZzmyo). It is again romantic longing for someone she can only dream about being with... the song ends on an exhale that really gets to me."

Even if they're playing mellower music from the 90s it wouldn't have that effect on your generation and a lot of older Gen-X folks.  Twenty years ago it probably would've been more 1950s music, but in another decade or two they'll probably shift forward to more 80s & 90s music."

      "comment_text": "I sometimes hear melodies or progressions that I absolutely love, but once I figure them out and have their formula mapped and labeled, it sort of takes away the surprise and initial magic I once felt. Sometimes I will intentionally not try to understand the theory behind a new sound that I enjoy to maintain that novel feeling. It's like seeing a magic trick but then learning how it's performed or something; reading the spell book.\n\nI also intentionally don't listen to all music from groups I know I will like. So for example I can still look forward to personally hearing *new* \"Beatles\" music, because I haven't listened to every one of their songs and it will be like a little gift waiting to be enjoyed."

In the past few years, I've maybe listened to it a handful of times, and it evokes some pretty strong feelings, both due to relatability and some past connections I've made with it. I cherish it so much, but there's a good chance that I may be able to count the number of times that I hear it for the remainder of my life on two hands. It's just that heavy."

They were played on BBC introducing Southwest last night.\n\n https://spotify.link/nYD0INqLUXb\n\n“Chemsong” is a dark, confessional track about an intoxicating, forbidden relationship that spirals from passion into chaos. Blending raw emotion with haunting vulnerability, it captures the thrill, guilt, and self-destruction that come with loving someone you know will ruin you. Exploring heavy and powerful guitars combined with soft and ambient vocals. Perfect for playlists that explore toxic love, late-night reflection, and emotional unraveling."

For me, this also represents something deeper, because it serves as a metaphor for all the times in my life I had to walk away from something I did not want to walk away from in order to start over and rebuild so as to create a better world for myself (if that makes sense). Perhaps you too have experienced this same scenario in your life and will relate to it in that sense.  \n  \nBeyond that, I had wanted to write an \"epic\" song (one that surpassed 7 minutes in length) for a long time. Not just in the traditional sense of longer-length, but in the sense of having multiple sections and each with their own different theme - all in one work. One day I happened to find myself in unfamiliar territory, plugged my guitar into an amplifier that wasn't mine and began playing by stream-of-consciousness. Thus, the riff that repeats itself throughout this song the most was born. In time, I decided it was good enough to be part of something bigger and continued to build upon it until eventually the final product arrived."

So instead of letting them collect dust, I decided to give them a home and let them breathe again.\n\nThe whole thing feels like walking through an empty city at 5 AM — grainy, emotional, slightly cold but still human.\n\nCheck it out if you’re into dark, cinematic, instrumentals. Would love to hear your honest thoughts — which one hits hardest, which one you’d write on, or just general feedback.\n\nMuch love, YOURZ"
