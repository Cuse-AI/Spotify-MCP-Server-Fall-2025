While often cryptic and musically avant garde (essentially spoken word over minimalist/experimental guitar and synth) I think it fits the bill of what you're looking for. \n\nE.g., their song about killing an insect that landed in your drink:\n\n> some kind of water insect flew into the room  \n> some kind of water-based insect swam into the room  \n> it's drifted away now though  \n> right out into the middle hours of the day  \n> but to see that winged Goliath ripple the coffee in the jugs  \n> i never thought such fragile insects would cause so much bad luck  \n> some kind of heaving heart beats in the milk  \n> some kind-hearted spoon to scoop it up and dry  \n> it's leg bleats and panic signals were loud and clear  \n> legs work in pulses by the saucer side  \n> but the trove spill over  \n> ripples wash away the thing  \n> it bursts in bubbles of soap and grease and is buried wetly down the plug  \n> tiny creature such bad luck.\n\n[The Shadow Ring - Tiny Creatures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0LUiliLTWA)"

Why'd she freak out?  \nI saw the bullet had got her right in the ear  \nI knew then the end was near  \nSo I ran down and I said, in her good ear  \n\"Debbie, why did you do it?\"  \nShe raised her head, smiled and said, \"I did it for Johnny\"\n\n  \nTori Amos is one of my favorite artists. Her song \"Silent All These Years\" has an extremely profound passage, though not humorous, hit me in the gut...\n\nSo you **found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts**. What's so amazing about **really deep thoughts**? Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon! How's that thought for you?\n\nRegina Spektor is also at masterfully turning a phrase. Her song \"Samson\" is one of her best:\n\nYou are my sweetest downfall  \nI loved you first, I loved you first  \nBeneath the sheets of paper lies my truth  \nI have to go, I have to go  \nYour hair was long when we first met  \nSamson went back to bed, not much hair left on his head  \nHe ate a slice of wonder bread, and went right back to bed  \nAnd history books forgot about us and the Bible didn't mention us  \nAnd the Bible didn't mention us, not even once.\n\nLily Allen is also worth checking out. Very tongue in cheek lyrics. \n\nFuck you (Fuck you), fuck you very, very much  \n['Cause we hate what you do](https://genius.com/6558170/Lily-allen-fuck-you/Cause-we-hate-what-you-do)  \n[And we hate your whole crew](https://genius.com/10812353/Lily-allen-fuck-you/And-we-hate-your-whole-crew)  \nSo please, don't stay in touch (Da-da, da-da, da-da, da)  \nFuck you (Fuck you), fuck you very, very much  \n['Cause your words don't translate](https://genius.com/17676166/Lily-allen-fuck-you/Cause-your-words-dont-translate)  \n[And it's getting quite late](https://genius.com/7727403/Lily-allen-fuck-you/And-its-getting-quite-late)  \nSo please, don't stay in touch"

Scarborough says such lullabies were sung by enslaved mammies to the white children in their care; \"the black mother often spent her tenderest love on the white child she nursed\" because, while she was in the plantation house, her own children were off in the slave quarters and often sold away."

It means a lot to me as someone born, raised, and still living in Kansas.\n\nBut the reason it makes me cry is it was also played at my Dad's funeral. He had played The Cowardly Lion in our community theater production back in the early 90s, and it's the role he was really known for locally. Hearing the song makes me realize how much I miss him, even 25+ years after his death.\n\nI love you Dad!"

I stumbled across a solo violinist playing Joji's \"Glimpse of Us,\" which is about a breakup and self-destructive behavior and depression - not really something I've experienced. But the plaintively evocative melody *did* speak to my experience of a lifetime of yearning, of finding love and losing it, in a way that made me break down in tears. Joji wasn't writing about losing a spouse to cancer - but he succeeded."

Let's see what I can add in that direction...\n\n1st suggestion us a band not for everyone but there's no denying the guitarists abilities,  not to mention the other players. This song jumps right in.\n\nThe Mars Volta, [L'via L'viquez](https://youtu.be/JphZtpafdKY?si=9UZAUsXLTZhfh9rQ)\n\n90s \n\nJeff Buckley was an all around amazing talent. Incredible lyrics, voice, sense of melody and guitar work. [Forget Her](https://youtu.be/yZhHtSJwjq0?si=yhgBQQdeMuDa2__3)\n\nTim Harrington was in The Masters of Reality. Serious chops and such a tone..[She Got Me (when she got her dress on)](https://youtu.be/WdbC9oolTTI?si=UQvM6pkOnfq2b8wv)\n\nA couple from the 70s..\n\nMichael Shenker was incredible. Started in the Scorpions then went to UF, which this is from.[Lights Out](https://youtu.be/VT4i1XR9sJI?si=uyMSIRGZyxavJ-5q)\n\nShuggie Otis is a Blues influenced player not too well known because he shied from the limelight. Began playing live in his father's band at around 13. Released his first album, I think, in '71. [Purple](https://youtu.be/PolCoN0ooyM?si=1M2_Jfw-PLeZb4--)\n\nTo name a few more popular people that get recognition in smaller crowds but generally not remembered for their guitars..\n\nPrince\n\nMike Campbell, TP and the Heartbreakers \n\nJohn \"Skunk\" Baxter, remembered most for his work in Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers \n\nSteve Lutherker, Toto bur also a prolific studio musician. Unknown to many he plays on many hit songs from around 80s era. Fun trivia fact...who was aware that Toto were the studio band Michael Jackson used for all of Thriller?\n\n\nLindsey Buckingham, Fleetwood Mac\n\nGlen Campbell,  country music's best?"

      "comment_text": "Well i'm a music person..\n\nSaying you listened to 200 albums doesnt really matter cause this is not a numbers game as in listening to as much music as possible. Just listening to a song once doesn't do much for most people.\n\nMost music is about tantric repetition. You can get into a very calm state of mind by listening to the same rytm for over 5 minutes. Listening to the same song repeatedly is also very statifying for your brain as it gets more and more comfortable being able to predict whats comming and getting into the rytm.\n\nThe emotional response is not something you are born with but its trained. Most of this has to happen on a very early age or around 10-14 years old for you to become a music person.\n\nUsually people link certain music to things they have experienced at the time they where listening to that type of music a lot. Or they link certain sounds to certain emotions. Many instruments mimic speach in some way while the rytm is the heartbeat and breathing tempo.\n\nI'm not a professor or anything just a musician and facinated by music.. so i'm sorry if this explanation is a bit to floaty 😅"

His death cemented him as a legend, but like you said, it prevented any Axl Rose-like downfall. There was no getting old and bitter and out of shape, that's what happens when you \"go out on top\".\n\nBack to the question though, Scott Weiland, I loved his work but he could have done so much more if he wasn't constantly battling his demons. STP had the potential to be big. Velvet Revolver had the potential for redemption. Neither really happened."

They have a lot of songs about trauma, depression, and feeling like an outsider because of mental illness. Their music can get really dark, but their newer stuff feels more hopeful. They're very noisy though and the vocals are very raw and off-note, so they're not for everyone. Their album *Peaceful as Hell* is probably the best one to start with.\n\nYou also might like the album *Monarch of Monsters* by Vylet Pony. I actually haven't listened to it, but it got a ton of buzz in the \"queer and mentally ill\" corner of the internet I get a lot of my music from. It's prog rock made by a trans woman, I'm not totally sure what the album is about but I know it's about dealing with trauma. The artist is a brony/furry lol but their music has gotten so much buzz even people who hate furries have listened to it and given it good reviews."
