And Jimmy Page, the band's guitarist, is even better as a producer.  He was a studio wizard.  Check out these songs for some of my favorites:\n\nWhole Lotta Love - Especially on headphones.  The way the song runs around your head is almost dizzying.\n\nBlack Dog - Feels like a punch you in the face rock song.  Until you realize the weird polyrhythmic thing it's doing in the drum and guitar groove.  \n\nWhen The Levee Breaks - The drum tone is UNREAL on this one.  It feels like the world is going to end.\n\nKashmir - The orchestra is such a nice touch.  \n\nFool in the Rain - The drummer (John Bonham) lays down the most amazing shuffle groove on this one.  Vibey, almost reggae feel to it."

She uses her voice very expressively to evoke longing. Another in that direction is [Without You](https://youtu.be/llRW86iUmi0?list=OLAK5uy_kasxGTq7NGoxiNyPC-f4uOPjJLUffaFPw) where you can just feel the rejection and emptiness she sings of. Again goosebumps. My favorite song by her is a very dreamy ballad in German called [Ladonia](https://youtu.be/1ZD_L6MXIXY?list=OLAK5uy_kCchlyv2-4yPsRTbNaimg_eGKWxtZzmyo). It is again romantic longing for someone she can only dream about being with... the song ends on an exhale that really gets to me."

      "comment_text": "You're lamenting a process, not music itself.  Purpose is subjective.\n\nFor some artists, it's making cool shit and hoping people find it catchy enough to throw money at you.  For others, they don't care about financial incentive as long as they successfully convey their zeitgeist.\n\nThink back to radio.  You'd hear the same tracks, dutifully repeated hour after hour.  Then, amazingly, the DJ slipped in a new song.  Good or bad?  It really didn't matter at that point - you'd assess it as an out-of-the-ordinary experience, sizing it up, building an internal response.  That process is long gone too.  There's no DJ, no selective expertise.  His function as the friendly curator is gone.  If you get new music at all, it's an algorithm serving up the same slop as your shitty playlist.  \n\n\"Authentic\" is the odd word in your post.  Illegally distributing CDs is a weird flex for authenticity.\n\nI'd argue streaming levels the playing field.  Payola is less obvious, but mindless drivel is more prevalent.  Talent is less a factor as musical tools become easier to use."

Even if they're playing mellower music from the 90s it wouldn't have that effect on your generation and a lot of older Gen-X folks.  Twenty years ago it probably would've been more 1950s music, but in another decade or two they'll probably shift forward to more 80s & 90s music."

Blending raw emotion with haunting vulnerability, it captures the thrill, guilt, and self-destruction that come with loving someone you know will ruin you. Exploring heavy and powerful guitars combined with soft and ambient vocals. Perfect for playlists that explore toxic love, late-night reflection, and emotional unraveling."

That's why I want to be upfront about the process and how I use it:\n\n* My lyrics are purely mine. My thoughts, my stories, and my personal experiences are the absolute starting point. I also compose all melodies on the piano first.\n* I use AI not as a ghostwriter, but as a powerful tool for rapid experimentation and sound design. Using tools like Suno Studio for rapid stem manipulation, I can instantly audition my core piano melody across dozens of instrumentations and genres. This allows me to explore and commit to a final arrangement much faster than I could using traditional software, without having to manually score or re-record every part. I guide and direct every step.\n* After the AI helps me explore and choose the best direction, I spend extensive time editing, mixing, and fine-tuning to ensure the track retains the emotional weight and personal touch of the original melody.\n\nMy goal is to take something fundamentally human and amplify its impact through technology, creating tracks that are personal, immersive, but uniquely a product of my own direction - I'm hoping that stands out with my songs. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on this process (and I promise the word \"neon\" will never show up in any of my music).\n\nAlso, any feedback on the above track from my Soundcloud would always be appreciated!"

So instead of letting them collect dust, I decided to give them a home and let them breathe again.\n\nThe whole thing feels like walking through an empty city at 5 AM — grainy, emotional, slightly cold but still human.\n\nCheck it out if you’re into dark, cinematic, instrumentals.

I caught them, one by one, and wove them into a melody.\n\nThis song is my answer. It was born in shadow, raised in silence. Every note is a dream that refuses to wake.\n\nAnd now, I'm inviting you to be the first to hear its heartbeat before it's unveiled to the world.\n\n**I'll be hosting the online premiere on Friday, 9 PM ET.**\n\nThink of it as our own midnight gathering. A brief escape from reality.\n\n**Premiere Link:** [`https://youtu.be/1dP00LR12E8`](https://youtu.be/1dP00LR12E8)\n\nIf you wish for this nocturne to live forever in your collection, you can Pre-Save it below. When released, it will slip into your library automatically, like a secret kept just for you.\n\n**Pre-Save Link:** [`https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/sylvanocturne/nightly-vibes-vol-1`](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/sylvanocturne/nightly-vibes-vol-1)\n\nI look forward to meeting you in the darkness of the premiere."
