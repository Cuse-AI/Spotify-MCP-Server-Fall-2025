This one was like the first time I actually was like, \"Woah, this is different.\" I also didn't really understand the fascination behind Adele until this track.

I find so much good new music by participating in these threads and listening to what others recommend.\n\nHere is yet another (for when you have time): [Bel Canto - The Suffering](https://youtu.be/Ik4GuD7aZ-M?list=OLAK5uy_mUZs3ubaX1NNItAXyrCHxUEwQNclOjTFM) The singer, Anneli Drecker is one of my favorites. She uses her voice very expressively to evoke longing. Another in that direction is [Without You](https://youtu.be/llRW86iUmi0?list=OLAK5uy_kasxGTq7NGoxiNyPC-f4uOPjJLUffaFPw) where you can just feel the rejection and emptiness she sings of. Again goosebumps. My favorite song by her is a very dreamy ballad in German called [Ladonia](https://youtu.be/1ZD_L6MXIXY?list=OLAK5uy_kCchlyv2-4yPsRTbNaimg_eGKWxtZzmyo). It is again romantic longing for someone she can only dream about being with... the song ends on an exhale that really gets to me."

Even if they're playing mellower music from the 90s it wouldn't have that effect on your generation and a lot of older Gen-X folks.  Twenty years ago it probably would've been more 1950s music, but in another decade or two they'll probably shift forward to more 80s & 90s music."

Despite his inexperience, Juno picked out \"Hollow Head\" as one of their favorite dubstep tracks of the year in 2023, ahead of acts like Hamdi. As a member of a collective called \"E-180\" with some incredible artists across Europe and beyond, there has been lots cooking including an upcoming compilation coming soon, which is one to keep an eye out for. Since hooking up with the Dance Mania Legends, DJ Slugo and DJ Phats, Dr FMW found his true calling. A release on Slugo's label meant so much to the Doc and his pals (having grown up as Ghetto tech superfans).

      "comment_text": "**DJ Slugo’s “A Blunt (Dr FMW Remix)” injects raw, rave-hardened energy into the original with a fierce blend of ghetto house, grime, and UK bass.** Irish-born Dr FMW draws on decades of underground experience to deliver a remix that's both unapologetically gritty and dancefloor-ready.\n\n**About Dr FMW:** Irish born Dr FMW aka DOCTAH has been heavily involved in music for over 20 years. He started off as a young rave slave traveling round the UK and Europe to see US techno legends like Rob Hood Ben Sims and Derrick May. In the 2010s in Manchester, England, Dubstep/Grime was new and blowing up. Raves like Sequence and Hit & Run were legendary and left a lasting impact on the artist. \"I only like raw music with attitude.\" Living with 7 friends, heavily involved in making music/DJing, then eventually putting on huge shows like Drum Clinic and Warehouse Project events in Manchester, Dr FMW certainly benefited from a stellar musical education (and received more than a few noise complaints along the way). He now produced Dubstep Grime UK Garage, Jungle and Ghetto House.\n\nIt is only in the past few years the Doc fell in love with producing after regularly being asked for advice by friends who were making music at the time. Something clicked. Starting in 2023, after teaching himself the ropes, there were quite a few label releases on various labels/genres (Dakrheart/MOR). Despite his inexperience, Juno picked out \"Hollow Head\" as one of their favorite dubstep tracks of the year in 2023, ahead of acts like Hamdi. As a member of a collective called \"E-180\" with some incredible artists across Europe and beyond, there has been lots cooking including an upcoming compilation coming soon, which is one to keep an eye out for. Since hooking up with the Dance Mania Legends, DJ Slugo and DJ Phats, Dr FMW found his true calling. A release on Slugo's label meant so much to the Doc and his pals (having grown up as Ghetto tech superfans).

So instead of letting them collect dust, I decided to give them a home and let them breathe again.\n\nThe whole thing feels like walking through an empty city at 5 AM — grainy, emotional, slightly cold but still human.\n\nCheck it out if you’re into dark, cinematic, instrumentals. Would love to hear your honest thoughts — which one hits hardest, which one you’d write on, or just general feedback.\n\nMuch love, YOURZ"

What's notable about the genre is that instrumentals and vocal songs are at a relatively even proportion.\n\nMy contribution is the last track at #15, but they're all great!"

The beat by Manny Mozart sets a gritty mood, and Benjy's baritone flow adds weight to every line. If you're into underground hip-hop or artists who emphasize lyricism and real-life narratives, this might resonate with you. I'd love to hear any thoughts!"

Performed entirely live with real instruments —ronroco and bowed strings, featuring rumbling, husky basses and cello— it captures the natural richness of a centuries-old room with nothing more than wood, strings, and two carefully placed microphones. Purely acoustic: fingers, breath, and space.\nBittersweet and in a minor key, the piece moves through a melancholic landscape before opening into a luminous major coda.\n\nThanks for listening, cheers DD"

The improvisation, the groove, the soul... it’s a language all its own. I honestly feel like every note tells a story, not just from the performer, but from the entire lineage of jazz history.\n\nLately, I’ve been trying to channel that inspiration into my own little creative space. I recently made a video (linked below) not just to play, but to *honor* the sound that’s given me so much joy. I tried to pour real love into every second of it. It's not perfect, but it's from the heart.\n\nIf you’re a fellow jazz lover, or just curious to hear someone explore that space, I’d be humbled if you gave it a listen. And more importantly—drop your favorite jazz artists below! I’m always looking to expand my listening.\n\n  \nPMP – Take Five | 60s Jazz Revival | 4K  \nHere’s the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKLPp2R1c9I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKLPp2R1c9I)  \nThanks for letting me share.

If you like math rock with adolescent emo vocals then give it a listen! Each song has something unique to offer, I dug into many niches for the guitar work from the proggier Chon riffs, Minus the Bear esc. tapping, and the fingerstyle of TTNG’s first record. If you play an instrument, you’ll get something out of it. lol"

The current political climate drove us to push this release up and feel it’s appropriate for current times. The song is riff driven with killer lead guitar work by our lead guitarist, Ben.\n\nWe are extremely proud of this one and hope you can all enjoy!

With soaring melodies, multilingual choral textures, and themes of unity and peace, the piece resonates as both a spiritual and cultural statement.**\n\nArnaud Fillion’s “Kune” (meaning “Together” in Esperanto) is a visionary symphonic work created for peace and cultural unification. Composed for symphony orchestra, multi-language choir, and soloists, “Kune” consists of 11 movements that weave together around 50 different languages to convey universal themes such as fraternity, empathy, respect beyond differences, and ecological awareness. This “symphony for peace” is more than just a musical piece—it is a collaborative human project, having involved nearly one hundred volunteers, translators, and cultural intermediaries in the writing process. Each text was carefully recorded as a phonetic reference to ensure authenticity and accessibility for the performers. The album was recorded in October 2023 in Lviv, Ukraine, featuring the Lviv National Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra and the “Gloria” Chamber Choir under the direction of Serhiy Khorovets.\n\n**Stream** Arnaud Fillion - \"Kune\" (performed by the Lviv National Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, Lviv Chamber choir Gloria, Serhiy Khorovets):\n\n* Spotify: [https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/album/3bqU1O2YSA8hKezpqY91iV](https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/album/3bqU1O2YSA8hKezpqY91iV)\n* YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy\\_m11khB-aEDXrwi-9oUQLyFX28cyP4h9ek](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m11khB-aEDXrwi-9oUQLyFX28cyP4h9ek)\n* Amazon Music: [https://music.amazon.fr/albums/B0D3FL6LW1](https://music.amazon.fr/albums/B0D3FL6LW1)\n* Deezer: [https://www.deezer.com/fr/album/582966632](https://www.deezer.com/fr/album/582966632)\n* Other Streaming Platforms: [https://li.sten.to/kune](https://li.sten.to/kune)"

      "comment_text": "Big Me - Foo Fighters.\n\nAt first, it reminded me of my mother, since I often heard that song on the radio with her (she passed away three years ago). It made me cry.\n\nThen, a few months after she passed away, I met a guy. We were friends for a couple years, then ended up dating for one. For some reason, that was our song. It would still make me happy cry because I appreciated him so much. \n\nThen, out of nowhere, he left over text, offered next to no explanation, and ghosted me forever afterwards. Hearing it now just makes me angry at myself for supposedly messing things up, him for doing that, and what I feel could have been in the future."
