      "comment_text": "Gaunt!!! Kind of a terrible name. Or maybe a great name, idk. But a fantastic band no matter what.\n\nGaunt was a mid-90s pop/punk band from Columbus, Ohio, that I think was better than any of the other Green Day-era pop/punk bands, by a fair margin. At their best, I think they were better than even Green Day themselves.\n\nStart with their album [*Yeah Me Too*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=vaSCSq1jn0k) from 1995 (10 songs in 21 minutes!) and follow that up with [*Kryptonite*](https://gaunt-tj.bandcamp.com/album/kryptonite) from 1996 (12 songs, 30 minutes, and all the songs are about Superman or breaking up, and sometimes both - this was before Goldfinger released their song \"Superman\" the following year).\n\nSeriously, listen to *Yeah Me Too* twice in a row, and all the songs are so singalong-able, you'll have them stuck in your head in no time. Great hooks, funny lyrics, loud punk-y tunes, they were fantastic.\n\nTheir other work is also good - *Sob Story* (1994) (more like a long EP than an album), *I Can See Your Mom From Here* (1994) (their rawest album), and *Bricks and Blackouts* (1997) (their most corporate album).\n\nThey had a weird trajectory - they broke up after *Kryptonite*, but somehow, Warner Brothers Records then offered them a recording contract. So they got back together to record *Bricks and Blackouts* - much more polished and corporate-sounding than their previous work, but with still lots of catchy pop-punk tunes. They didn't tour for the album, and then immediately broke up again. \n\nAnd if you listen to that one after listening to their other four albums, you can also see how the major labels did a lot to ruin the genre, hence your distaste for Sum 41, Blink-182, Fall Out Boy, etc. Listen to their first four albums, and you'll get major \"peak Green Day\" vibes. Then listen to *Bricks and Blackouts*, and you'll be like, \"Yup, the way this is recorded sounds more like how Blink-182 was recorded than like Green Day\". Which is too bad, because there *are* some great songs on the album, but it somehow sounds insincere and plastic.\n\nThere won't be any reunion of Gaunt, unfortunately, because the frontman/singer/songwriter was killed on New Year's Day, 2000, in a hit-and-run when biking home. Tragic end to a great, very overlooked pop-punk band.  \n\n/fanboy rant"

The song was written by three songwriters who took an old French ballad called \"Plaisir d'amour\", changed the music a little bit and added English lyrics to it.\n\nElvis recorded it first.  It appears in the movie \"Blue Hawaii\", and while it's mostly him with a piano providing a simple melody, there are all kinds of other instruments in it - an upright bass, drums, background singers, a harmonica, guitars, and a ukulele.\n\nNow, I don't know what the song looked like on paper when it was written, or what the demo sounded like if one was recorded, but I can guarantee you it didn't have a ukulele in it.  That, and probably most of the other instruments, were added by whoever arranged the song for Elvis.\n\nSo this will be one of those situations where you just listen to a bunch of different versions, decide which one you like the best, then put that one on your playlists."

The song was written by three songwriters who took an old French ballad called \"Plaisir d'amour\", changed the music a little bit and added English lyrics to it.\n\nElvis recorded it first.  It appears in the movie \"Blue Hawaii\", and while it's mostly him with a piano providing a simple melody, there are all kinds of other instruments in it - an upright bass, drums, background singers, a harmonica, guitars, and a ukulele.\n\nNow, I don't know what the song looked like on paper when it was written, or what the demo sounded like if one was recorded, but I can guarantee you it didn't have a ukulele in it.  That, and probably most of the other instruments, were added by whoever arranged the song for Elvis.\n\nSo this will be one of those situations where you just listen to a bunch of different versions, decide which one you like the best, then put that one on your playlists."

Shit you can bang your head to to.\n\n> Lyrically, metal also moves far beyond the simplicity of rock. Instead of party anthems or love songs\n\nRock dealt with heavy topics before metal existed, and there are metal bands that focus on party anthems. Metal does *tend* to have heavy subjects, but it's neither necessary nor sufficient.\n\n> So in my view, if the bare minimum for metal begins with the evolved NWOBHM sound\n\nWhy would the *New Wave* of British Heavy Metal be the \"bare minimum\"? Metal was already established by then.\n\n\"There are many bands before Black Sabbath that are said to have invented heavy metal. There are none after Black Sabbath.\" Can't find the source of that line, but it's 100% true. I've also heard \"Black Sabbath may not have made the first metal song, but they definitely made the first metal *album,*\" and there's truth to that as well."

Freaky Friday by Crhis Brown I only have this version because I got it from the store where I work, I searched on the internet and I never found this rock version of Freaky Friday. The song Laura by Kevin S. I'm not sure if it's really called that. Kevin S. is a German singer and I only understand the part of the chorus where he says Laura and I assume that's the name of the song. And as for Trevor Scott, it's Trevor Scott and not Travis Scott. I even hate Travis Scott because when I search the internet for Trevor Scott even though I spell it correctly \"Trevor Scott\" Travis Scott appears."

I then listened to all of her songs since then and i love ALL of them. I guess she's so talented that she sounds good no matter the song. \n\nI think i usually know if i like a song/artist on first listen. However, there may be times when I'm not that into the specific song, but i recognise that the artist is really good (vocally speaking for me) then I'll make an effort to search more songs by them.\n\nI do not care about albums at all. I'll just check out the songs individually.\n\nThere may also be lyrically dense songs that take multiple listens to understand. Not to say i didn't like them on first listen, but may have took longer to truly appreciate them."

It probably won't be topping my chart anytime soon, but it sounds good enough and recognisable.\n\nThe chord progression reminds me of one of Michelle's songs, \"Sweet Misery\", due to the half-step downwards in the bass line that creates a \"crying\" feeling. The chord progression immediately gives the song a happy-sad atmosphere.\n\nMeanwhile, the drumming reminds me of Michelle's husband Patrick Carney of The Black Keys, so I quickly connected the song with the indie rock genre."

      "comment_text": "I’m a classically trained musician (like you, OP: piano, violin & choirs) but in my early 20s got into playing in bands. Listened to a *lot* of different genres and was lucky to have muso friends who were like me curious and open to anything they intuitively liked. \n\nThere’s no ‘right’ music. Anyone who tells you “cringe” is probably more interested in social approval than actual music. \n\nSo let me list just a few of my favourite bands / musicians who are musically wonderful but - more important - have something special about creating a mood or sound that’s distinctively theirs. And often either original or an ingenious and engaging development of something that’s gone before. Btw if you’re looking for a ‘bridge’ between genres (classical, pop, jazz, folk, rock, etc), listen to musicians who themselves understood and loved the value of listening to and crossing between multiple genres. \n\nSome random examples then:\n\nAnna Lapwood - a musician’s musician, she’s as happy conducting a madrigal choir as belting out film themes or trance music on a concert hall organ. She’s all over the socials, easy to find. Similarly: Jacob Collier, Laura Mvula. \n\nLed Zeppelin - There’s a reason people are still listening to this stuff 50 years later. Four musicians at the very top of their game, drawing on influences of jazz, folk, funk, and blues, to create something new. Many of their (very many!) concerts were extended ‘jams’, where they never played the same version of a song twice. Start with their gentler stuff like ‘Bron-Yr-Aur’ and ‘Black Mountain Side’, work your way towards the epics like ‘Kashmir’ and ‘Achilles Last Stand’.\n\nInvest time in navigating how popular music developed from roots like musical hall, spirituals, blues and jazz. The best rock bands also put in study time to this. The Beatles’ work with George Martin ranges from simple pop (Love Me Do) to music hall (With A Little Help From My Friends) to classical/art-house epic crossover (A Day In The Life) and beyond. The Who’s manager/producer (Kit Lambert) was a classical musician who encouraged them to cross genres - resulting in ‘rock operas’ Tommy and Quadrophenia. (Try listening to ‘Love Reign Oer Me’, or ‘Baba O’Reilly’ to hear genre-crossing in real time.)\n\nSo, a tiny selection of jazz etc worth a listen: George Gershwin (eg ‘Gershwin Plays Gershwin’ album). Ella Fitzgerald. Duke Ellington. Art Blakey. Dave Brubeck. Miles Davis. \n\nThen on the border between spiritual and soul: Nina Simone. Sly and the Family Stone. The Staple Singers. Any good Motown compilation. Watch on YouTube, ‘Wattstax’ or ‘Summer Of Soul’ for a crash course on why this is good music.\n\nA few of the best albums *musically* that will help stretch your head and work out what you enjoy:\n\nPaul Simon - Graceland. (Genius New York lyricist goes to South Africa and BOOM, one of the great creative collisions happens)\n\nMiles Davis - Kind Of Blue. (Don’t try to rationalise it. Immerse your ears and soul. It’ll either get you, or it won’t. If it doesn’t, never mind.)\n\nNorah Jones - Come Away With Me. (Honey for the ears. Jazz and pop merge.)\n\nLed Zeppelin - III. (Not their most popular album, but showcases their musical range best.) If you like it, go on to IV which is kinda the gold standard for what they achieved. \n\nPink Floyd - Dark Side Of The Moon. (Maybe a 1970s period piece now, but it shows what happens when you stick a bunch of open-minded musicians in a studio with a huge stack of then-newly-invented synthesizers. And they create perhaps the ultimate album about what it means to be alive.)\n\nThe Beatles - Abbey Road\n\nJoni Mitchell - Hejira\n\nThe Beach Boys - Pet Sounds\n\nThe above are all very much ‘classic era’ (late c20th) albums of course. A few other thoughts that might help:\n\nWatch concert footage. The benchmark here is probably Talking Heads ‘Stop Making Sense’ (Jonathan Demme’s film of their Hollywood concert tour.) Pure joy, great collision of funk, arthouse, bayou, and just great danceability. Or just jump on YouTube and follow your instincts for any music that tickles you. \n\nListen to the ‘Add To Playlist’ podcast. Just binge all the series! It’s one of the rare platforms where they welcome musicians from all genres to share any piece that they love. \n\nChoose a good strand of ‘music deconstruction’ podcast or YouTube show, and browse it. Fwiw I enjoy ‘What Makes This Song Great’ by Rick Beato - cos he’s a record producer *and* music professor. Songs are often so much more enjoyable when you’ve heard them ‘disassembled’ by a mixing desk into component instrumental tracks. \n\nDon’t waste time on YouTube ‘reaction videos’. They’re fun for maybe 3 minutes, then just a massive time-sucking rabbit hole that adds nothing to your musical enjoyment. \n\nAny questions?"

      "comment_text": "I’m a classically trained musician (like you, OP: piano, violin & choirs) but in my early 20s got into playing in bands. Listened to a *lot* of different genres and was lucky to have muso friends who were like me curious and open to anything they intuitively liked. \n\nThere’s no ‘right’ music. Anyone who tells you “cringe” is probably more interested in social approval than actual music. \n\nSo let me list just a few of my favourite bands / musicians who are musically wonderful but - more important - have something special about creating a mood or sound that’s distinctively theirs. And often either original or an ingenious and engaging development of something that’s gone before. Btw if you’re looking for a ‘bridge’ between genres (classical, pop, jazz, folk, rock, etc), listen to musicians who themselves understood and loved the value of listening to and crossing between multiple genres. \n\nSome random examples then:\n\nAnna Lapwood - a musician’s musician, she’s as happy conducting a madrigal choir as belting out film themes or trance music on a concert hall organ. She’s all over the socials, easy to find. Similarly: Jacob Collier, Laura Mvula. \n\nLed Zeppelin - There’s a reason people are still listening to this stuff 50 years later. Four musicians at the very top of their game, drawing on influences of jazz, folk, funk, and blues, to create something new. Many of their (very many!) concerts were extended ‘jams’, where they never played the same version of a song twice. Start with their gentler stuff like ‘Bron-Yr-Aur’ and ‘Black Mountain Side’, work your way towards the epics like ‘Kashmir’ and ‘Achilles Last Stand’.\n\nInvest time in navigating how popular music developed from roots like musical hall, spirituals, blues and jazz. The best rock bands also put in study time to this. The Beatles’ work with George Martin ranges from simple pop (Love Me Do) to music hall (With A Little Help From My Friends) to classical/art-house epic crossover (A Day In The Life) and beyond. The Who’s manager/producer (Kit Lambert) was a classical musician who encouraged them to cross genres - resulting in ‘rock operas’ Tommy and Quadrophenia. (Try listening to ‘Love Reign Oer Me’, or ‘Baba O’Reilly’ to hear genre-crossing in real time.)\n\nSo, a tiny selection of jazz etc worth a listen: George Gershwin (eg ‘Gershwin Plays Gershwin’ album). Ella Fitzgerald. Duke Ellington. Art Blakey. Dave Brubeck. Miles Davis. \n\nThen on the border between spiritual and soul: Nina Simone. Sly and the Family Stone. The Staple Singers. Any good Motown compilation. Watch on YouTube, ‘Wattstax’ or ‘Summer Of Soul’ for a crash course on why this is good music.\n\nA few of the best albums *musically* that will help stretch your head and work out what you enjoy:\n\nPaul Simon - Graceland. (Genius New York lyricist goes to South Africa and BOOM, one of the great creative collisions happens)\n\nMiles Davis - Kind Of Blue. (Don’t try to rationalise it. Immerse your ears and soul. It’ll either get you, or it won’t. If it doesn’t, never mind.)\n\nNorah Jones - Come Away With Me. (Honey for the ears. Jazz and pop merge.)\n\nLed Zeppelin - III. (Not their most popular album, but showcases their musical range best.) If you like it, go on to IV which is kinda the gold standard for what they achieved. \n\nPink Floyd - Dark Side Of The Moon. (Maybe a 1970s period piece now, but it shows what happens when you stick a bunch of open-minded musicians in a studio with a huge stack of then-newly-invented synthesizers. And they create perhaps the ultimate album about what it means to be alive.)\n\nThe Beatles - Abbey Road\n\nJoni Mitchell - Hejira\n\nThe Beach Boys - Pet Sounds\n\nThe above are all very much ‘classic era’ (late c20th) albums of course. A few other thoughts that might help:\n\nWatch concert footage. The benchmark here is probably Talking Heads ‘Stop Making Sense’ (Jonathan Demme’s film of their Hollywood concert tour.) Pure joy, great collision of funk, arthouse, bayou, and just great danceability. Or just jump on YouTube and follow your instincts for any music that tickles you. \n\nListen to the ‘Add To Playlist’ podcast. Just binge all the series! It’s one of the rare platforms where they welcome musicians from all genres to share any piece that they love. \n\nChoose a good strand of ‘music deconstruction’ podcast or YouTube show, and browse it. Fwiw I enjoy ‘What Makes This Song Great’ by Rick Beato - cos he’s a record producer *and* music professor. Songs are often so much more enjoyable when you’ve heard them ‘disassembled’ by a mixing desk into component instrumental tracks. \n\nDon’t waste time on YouTube ‘reaction videos’. They’re fun for maybe 3 minutes, then just a massive time-sucking rabbit hole that adds nothing to your musical enjoyment. \n\nAny questions?"

Granted I really am not into the Beyonce ethos at all. When I proved this person wrong, within three replies they do the classic \"I'm having last word and not replying anymore\" bs response after posting some weak comment about the word baller used. \n\nAs for me mentioning something is \"problematic\", if I didn't and I thought it was, isn't that misleading? If I didn't and let it just be decided by the reader it was, would it be bad? The fact of the matter is I can see how some parts aren't in the best light and could lead someone to think it is about someone who wants to be wined and dined. The reality is she like in Independent Woman (which I can't say I've ever looked at the lyrics to not remember half) says she ideally wants it 50-50 and by what she is saying it is an 80-20 relationship at the moment in time of the song.\n\nAlso I do believe that some songs are better to deep dive into than others. I mean as much as may like Nickelback as \"guilty pleasure\" (I truly don't believe in that term), I can't deep dive into \"Burn It to the Ground\" or do it for \"No Scrubs.\" \"Burn It to the Ground\" is really just a drinking party song and that's it and I understand that being one of the songs Nickelback is stacked for. \"No Scrubs\" is literally just comments about guy who isn't worth the time of day trying to get the attention of a woman."

I also know that it is a cut throat industry to be in, and if you can not figure things out without a personal Reddit concierge you may just not be cut out for it. I'd say most importantly you need to know when you need a lawyer to look over stuff you do and paperwork you sign, because it sounds like you will be taken advantage of left and right with everyone seeing your naiveté coming out of your pores. \n\nThere are a lot of talented musicians out there, but you also need to be a shrewd businessperson if you want to make music your job and you definitely need to work on that."
