      "comment_text": "'79 here. It's been a wild ride.\n\nMonopolistic corporatization of the industry have killed most of the radio and a lot of venues for music.  This killed a lot of interest from listeners. And there has also been soooo much music recorded that one could listen to music constantly and never hear the same thing twice over several lifetimes. It may take me the rest of my life just to get Thru [Fela Kuti](https://youtu.be/q2E32KsPWhs?si=04FaSoCW0gOMD7-X)'s catalog.\n\nHowever technology has always disrupted the music industry and continues to do so. The barrier for entry of the musician to \"release\" music has not ever been lower.  [Steve Lacy](https://youtu.be/x-OzspEcQG8?si=a74xK3FMQI8UbHFn) made his \"Steve Lacy's Demo\" EP using just a phone and a couple instruments, nearly 10 years ago. His [TED talk](https://youtu.be/SUnmrQfdYpg?si=eNB4sCEhMkVqB0Ce) shows that you shouldn't let lack of fancy stuff stop you. The new technology means that more *good* new music is being produced now than at any time ever, and in all genre.  It can be overwhelming to navigate an ocean of new and old music.\n\nThat change isn't all sunshine and roses.  The fall of the recording studio proper also carries with it some loss in production knowledge.  A lot of new things aren't as \"slick\" sounding as older releases.  But the music is strong.\n\n[Folk](https://youtu.be/TCsFgJsJ5Uc?si=X8XJjfy9RZcBt6dJ) and [jazz]( https://youtu.be/fsjC8xYW9l8?si=kG-D3XmD5j8VnzAa) are each on fire right now. Throwback Bossa Nova artist [Pedro Mizutani](https://youtu.be/eXAUrGi4s7o?si=uuFphb3hrToYFs40) can tour Europe performing, powered by TikTok views.  \n\nOne that very strongly resonated for me is [Ginger Root](https://youtu.be/PiOdGpR0TdU?si=ZlhxJ5clfqzBsGk3)'s album from last year, *Shinbangumi*, blending Japanese City Pop with throwback 1980s television aesthetics and great storytelling.  The throwback aesthetic that he's mastered is deceptive.  This simply could not have existed before the decade we are living in."

I find so much good new music by participating in these threads and listening to what others recommend.\n\nHere is yet another (for when you have time): [Bel Canto - The Suffering](https://youtu.be/Ik4GuD7aZ-M?list=OLAK5uy_mUZs3ubaX1NNItAXyrCHxUEwQNclOjTFM) The singer, Anneli Drecker is one of my favorites. She uses her voice very expressively to evoke longing. Another in that direction is [Without You](https://youtu.be/llRW86iUmi0?list=OLAK5uy_kasxGTq7NGoxiNyPC-f4uOPjJLUffaFPw) where you can just feel the rejection and emptiness she sings of. Again goosebumps. My favorite song by her is a very dreamy ballad in German called [Ladonia](https://youtu.be/1ZD_L6MXIXY?list=OLAK5uy_kCchlyv2-4yPsRTbNaimg_eGKWxtZzmyo). It is again romantic longing for someone she can only dream about being with... the song ends on an exhale that really gets to me."

      "comment_text": "If the restaurants and pubs you're talking about are corporate chains then they probably don't have much choice as the music played is approved by the same people who approve the logo and branding, the decor, the nicknames of food on the menu and so forth.\n\nThat music will be familiar and comfortable to any age demographic and provide almost a subliminal appeal even if you don't particularly notice the music playing.  Even if they're playing mellower music from the 90s it wouldn't have that effect on your generation and a lot of older Gen-X folks.  Twenty years ago it probably would've been more 1950s music, but in another decade or two they'll probably shift forward to more 80s & 90s music."

      "comment_text": "Check out new release from UK based, Female fronted, band Leonard and the Zombies They’re post Grunge / Alt Rock with a bit of Riot girl thrown in. They were played on BBC introducing Southwest last night.\n\n https://spotify.link/nYD0INqLUXb\n\n“Chemsong” is a dark, confessional track about an intoxicating, forbidden relationship that spirals from passion into chaos. Blending raw emotion with haunting vulnerability, it captures the thrill, guilt, and self-destruction that come with loving someone you know will ruin you. Exploring heavy and powerful guitars combined with soft and ambient vocals. Perfect for playlists that explore toxic love, late-night reflection, and emotional unraveling."

That's why I want to be upfront about the process and how I use it:\n\n* My lyrics are purely mine. My thoughts, my stories, and my personal experiences are the absolute starting point. I also compose all melodies on the piano first.\n* I use AI not as a ghostwriter, but as a powerful tool for rapid experimentation and sound design. Using tools like Suno Studio for rapid stem manipulation, I can instantly audition my core piano melody across dozens of instrumentations and genres. This allows me to explore and commit to a final arrangement much faster than I could using traditional software, without having to manually score or re-record every part. I guide and direct every step.\n* After the AI helps me explore and choose the best direction, I spend extensive time editing, mixing, and fine-tuning to ensure the track retains the emotional weight and personal touch of the original melody.\n\nMy goal is to take something fundamentally human and amplify its impact through technology, creating tracks that are personal, immersive, but uniquely a product of my own direction - I'm hoping that stands out with my songs. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on this process (and I promise the word \"neon\" will never show up in any of my music).\n\nAlso, any feedback on the above track from my Soundcloud would always be appreciated!"

For me, this also represents something deeper, because it serves as a metaphor for all the times in my life I had to walk away from something I did not want to walk away from in order to start over and rebuild so as to create a better world for myself (if that makes sense). Perhaps you too have experienced this same scenario in your life and will relate to it in that sense.  \n  \nBeyond that, I had wanted to write an \"epic\" song (one that surpassed 7 minutes in length) for a long time. Not just in the traditional sense of longer-length, but in the sense of having multiple sections and each with their own different theme - all in one work. One day I happened to find myself in unfamiliar territory, plugged my guitar into an amplifier that wasn't mine and began playing by stream-of-consciousness. Thus, the riff that repeats itself throughout this song the most was born. In time, I decided it was good enough to be part of something bigger and continued to build upon it until eventually the final product arrived."

      "comment_text": "**\"in ur eyes\" by Dr FMW is an emotional deep dubstep track with bittersweet vocals and heavy UK style wobble bass line.** Drawing from his roots in rave culture and grime-soaked Manchester nights, the track balances tenderness with raw, subterranean weight.\n\n**About Dr FMW:** Irish born Dr FMW a.k.a. DOCTAH has been heavily involved in music for over 20 years. He started off as a young rave slave traveling round the UK and Europe to see US techno legends like Rob Hood Ben Sims and Derrick May. In the 2010s in Manchester, England, Dubstep/Grime was new and blowing up. Raves like Sequence and Hit & Run were legendary and left a lasting impact on the artist. \"I only like raw music with attitude.\" Living with 7 friends, heavily involved in making music/DJing, then eventually putting on huge shows like Drum Clinic and Warehouse Project events in Manchester, Dr FMW certainly benefited from a stellar musical education (and received more than a few noise complaints along the way). He now produced Dubstep Grime UK Garage, Jungle and Ghetto House.\n\nIt is only in the past few years the Doc fell in love with producing after regularly being asked for advice by friends who were making music at the time. Something clicked. Starting in 2023, after teaching himself the ropes, there were quite a few label releases on various labels/genres (Dakrheart/MOR). Despite his inexperience, Juno picked out \"Hollow Head\" as one of their favorite dubstep tracks of the year in 2023, ahead of acts like Hamdi. As a member of a collective called \"E-180\" with some incredible artists across Europe and beyond, there has been lots cooking including an upcoming compilation coming soon, which is one to keep an eye out for. Since hooking up with the Dance Mania Legends, DJ Slugo and DJ Phats, Dr FMW found his true calling. A release on Slugo's label meant so much to the Doc and his pals (having grown up as Ghetto tech superfans). The journey has a lot left to run so with God's blessings, some more great music will be dropping in the months and years to come.\n\n**Stream** Dr FMW - \"in ur eyes\" on Spotify: [https://open.spotify.com/album/7bmoNp5PBFKyeNA4GzVPMB](https://open.spotify.com/album/7bmoNp5PBFKyeNA4GzVPMB)"

      "comment_text": "They say the night holds the deepest secrets.\n\nOn countless sleepless nights, I've walked alone under the moonlight, collecting forgotten dreams, fleeting thoughts, and the murmurs in the wind. I caught them, one by one, and wove them into a melody.\n\nThis song is my answer. It was born in shadow, raised in silence. Every note is a dream that refuses to wake.\n\nAnd now, I'm inviting you to be the first to hear its heartbeat before it's unveiled to the world.\n\n**I'll be hosting the online premiere on Friday, 9 PM ET.**\n\nThink of it as our own midnight gathering. A brief escape from reality.\n\n**Premiere Link:** [`https://youtu.be/1dP00LR12E8`](https://youtu.be/1dP00LR12E8)\n\nIf you wish for this nocturne to live forever in your collection, you can Pre-Save it below. When released, it will slip into your library automatically, like a secret kept just for you.\n\n**Pre-Save Link:** [`https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/sylvanocturne/nightly-vibes-vol-1`](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/sylvanocturne/nightly-vibes-vol-1)\n\nI look forward to meeting you in the darkness of the premiere."

      "comment_text": "Hiii so I'm a experimental producer and I've just released my first song, is IDM/ambient, I've been wanting to release my music seriously for years, but I didn't feel confident enough for others to listen to it, however I decided to ignore the fear and release it. It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think! Thanks so much! Here's the link to the song on Spotify but it's on Apple Music, Deezer and almost all platforms too:\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/3porKsR3WhmOfJInQYXeK5](https://open.spotify.com/track/3porKsR3WhmOfJInQYXeK5)\n\n\n\nAnd my second song is already up exclusively to SoundCloud right now but going onto the other streaming services in like 15 days, here's the link:\n\n\n\n[https://soundcloud.com/kasprikkk/detached-stars-kasprikkk](https://soundcloud.com/kasprikkk/detached-stars-kasprikkk)"

I only discovered them through random Instagram & TikTok reels and I instantly got hooked and became one of their new fans. This band will definitely take you back again to that 2000's MySpace era w/ their music. They just got that original & classic pop-punk sound and I would like to help them out to blow up somehow just to show my support to the band because this type of sound is one of the sounds we also need to hear in this modern times.\n\nFFO: Simple Plan, State Champs, The Paradox\n\nWATCH Here:\nhttps://youtu.be/Emy66y07MHk\n\nSTREAM Here: https://open.spotify.com/track/6yXekOrMatOvZ9cCAROrvu"

What's notable about the genre is that instrumentals and vocal songs are at a relatively even proportion.\n\nMy contribution is the last track at #15, but they're all great!"

It's out on all platforms!\n\n[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7B3C7wClpaOReVCMxFi5AE)\n\n[Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-world-as-i-know-it/1809874257)\n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nrl2R49y0QdfH1ApUfiO2OkdHGvLoNbAg)"

Being a musician, all I could do to go through it is making this song...\n\nI'd love to discuss the song with you, as it means a lot to me. Cheers!"

One of my Neighbors actually wrote the lyrics of 'Loneliness'. My mother knew them personally and often listened to their rehearsal.\n\n\nBesides 'Take Leave' there were two other songs that were really important to me: 'Once Upon a Time' and 'Loneliness'. All of them from an Album called 'Another Way' (1993)\n\n\nOnce Upon a Time: https://youtu.be/-zb8pbBRkxw?si=_rZ6dg8PdrN0E9j5\n\n\nLoneliness: https://youtu.be/wvADQVOpq6Y?si=wDl5r0qq1RArhKnS\n\n\nSome nice old school rock, I'd be really happy if more people knew about  them! :')"
