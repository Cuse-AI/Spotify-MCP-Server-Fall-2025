It was like hanging out with your friends dad but then random people come up to him and are like \"Are you STINGER?\" \n\nWWE superstars have to buy all their own wardrobe shit so we're walking through a mall in Texas talking business and STINGER stops in front of a womans clothing store. They had this gothic looking robe in the window. He comes out a bit later looking disappointed he says \"They didn't have it XXXL\"\n\nRyan Reynolds is a dick who pretends to be nice… \n\nAntonio Brown is batshit crazy but has charisma in spades. Dude moves like a human panther. It's crazy how agile he is in real life.

He started off as a young rave slave traveling round the UK and Europe to see US techno legends like Rob Hood Ben Sims and Derrick May. In the 2010s in Manchester, England, Dubstep/Grime was new and blowing up. Raves like Sequence and Hit & Run were legendary and left a lasting impact on the artist. \"I only like raw music with attitude.\" Living with 7 friends, heavily involved in making music/DJing, then eventually putting on huge shows like Drum Clinic and Warehouse Project events in Manchester, Dr FMW certainly benefited from a stellar musical education (and received more than a few noise complaints along the way). He now produced Dubstep Grime UK Garage, Jungle and Ghetto House.\n\nIt is only in the past few years the Doc fell in love with producing after regularly being asked for advice by friends who were making music at the time. Something clicked. Starting in 2023, after teaching himself the ropes, there were quite a few label releases on various labels/genres (Dakrheart/MOR). Despite his inexperience, Juno picked out \"Hollow Head\" as one of their favorite dubstep tracks of the year in 2023, ahead of acts like Hamdi. As a member of a collective called \"E-180\" with some incredible artists across Europe and beyond, there has been lots cooking including an upcoming compilation coming soon, which is one to keep an eye out for. Since hooking up with the Dance Mania Legends, DJ Slugo and DJ Phats, Dr FMW found his true calling. A release on Slugo's label meant so much to the Doc and his pals (having grown up as Ghetto tech superfans).

      "comment_text": "**DJ Slugo’s “A Blunt (Dr FMW Remix)” injects raw, rave-hardened energy into the original with a fierce blend of ghetto house, grime, and UK bass.** Irish-born Dr FMW draws on decades of underground experience to deliver a remix that's both unapologetically gritty and dancefloor-ready.\n\n**About Dr FMW:** Irish born Dr FMW aka DOCTAH has been heavily involved in music for over 20 years. He started off as a young rave slave traveling round the UK and Europe to see US techno legends like Rob Hood Ben Sims and Derrick May. In the 2010s in Manchester, England, Dubstep/Grime was new and blowing up. Raves like Sequence and Hit & Run were legendary and left a lasting impact on the artist. \"I only like raw music with attitude.\" Living with 7 friends, heavily involved in making music/DJing, then eventually putting on huge shows like Drum Clinic and Warehouse Project events in Manchester, Dr FMW certainly benefited from a stellar musical education (and received more than a few noise complaints along the way). He now produced Dubstep Grime UK Garage, Jungle and Ghetto House.\n\nIt is only in the past few years the Doc fell in love with producing after regularly being asked for advice by friends who were making music at the time. Something clicked. Starting in 2023, after teaching himself the ropes, there were quite a few label releases on various labels/genres (Dakrheart/MOR). Despite his inexperience, Juno picked out \"Hollow Head\" as one of their favorite dubstep tracks of the year in 2023, ahead of acts like Hamdi. As a member of a collective called \"E-180\" with some incredible artists across Europe and beyond, there has been lots cooking including an upcoming compilation coming soon, which is one to keep an eye out for. Since hooking up with the Dance Mania Legends, DJ Slugo and DJ Phats, Dr FMW found his true calling. A release on Slugo's label meant so much to the Doc and his pals (having grown up as Ghetto tech superfans). The journey has a lot left to run so with God's blessings, some more great music will be dropping in the months and years to come.\n\n**Stream** DJ Slugo - A Blunt (Dr FMW Remix) on Spotify: [https://open.spotify.com/track/4rJvWjO6tSXgYYsBOIQcMt](https://open.spotify.com/track/4rJvWjO6tSXgYYsBOIQcMt)",

'Vogue' is upbeat, confident, and club-oriented, while the described track appears to be soulful, emotional, and jazz-influenced.

      "comment_text": "**“I Try” Featuring Imani Grace** is a soulful, groove-rich reimagining of Angela Bofill’s timeless ballad, serving as the debut single from *Funk Asylum Vol. 1*. Anchored by the dynamic drumming of Forrest Robinson, the track preserves the emotional weight of the original while layering in fresh textures: Imani-Grace’s heartfelt vocals, Gerald Albright’s velvety saxophone solo, and a sweeping string arrangement from John Clayton. At the production helm, multi–Grammy Award-winner Ralph Johnson of Earth, Wind & Fire infuses decades of mastery, honoring funk and R&B traditions while pushing them forward. Guided by Funk Asylum’s values—Stewardship, Community, Expression, Preservation, and Spread Love—“I Try” bridges generations, carrying the soul of classic balladry into the present with authenticity, joy, and purpose.\n\n**Forrest Robinson’s Funk Asylum** isn’t just keeping funk alive, it’s reviving its sacred pulse. With *Funk Asylum Vol. 1*, the veteran drummer, musical director, and innovator launches an electrifying homage to the golden era of funk (1976–1985), channeling the spirit of Rick James, The Brothers Johnson, Angela Bofill, and Shalamar with fierce originality and reverence. Produced alongside Earth, Wind & Fire’s Ralph Johnson, the project features lush arrangements, blazing horn lines, and groove-driven foundations—a spiritual continuation of Black American musical legacy that Robinson calls an *“apostolic succession.”* Backed by Executive Producer Lindsey Nelson and a world-class ensemble—including Tak Nakazawa, Isha Love, Robin Bramlett, David Leach, Michael Angel Alvarado, and powerhouse vocalists Lauren Evans, Imani-Grace, Mabvuto, and Frank McComb—Funk Asylum delivers a high-voltage celebration of heritage, crafted with reverence, intention, and cultural clarity.\n\n**Stream** Forrest Robinson’s Funk Asylum – “I Try” (feat.

The human requested songs 'to just relax' and recommended classic rock/folk relaxation tracks (Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Hot Tuna - all mellow, acoustic-oriented songs). However, the Spotify-validated song is 'Mercy' by Kanye West, which is an aggressive, high-energy hip-hop track with heavy production and intense delivery - the complete opposite of relaxing music. This appears to be a data validation error rather than a legitimate recommendation for relaxation.",
