That's why I want to be upfront about the process and how I use it:\n\n* My lyrics are purely mine. My thoughts, my stories, and my personal experiences are the absolute starting point. I also compose all melodies on the piano first.\n* I use AI not as a ghostwriter, but as a powerful tool for rapid experimentation and sound design. Using tools like Suno Studio for rapid stem manipulation, I can instantly audition my core piano melody across dozens of instrumentations and genres. This allows me to explore and commit to a final arrangement much faster than I could using traditional software, without having to manually score or re-record every part. I guide and direct every step.\n* After the AI helps me explore and choose the best direction, I spend extensive time editing, mixing, and fine-tuning to ensure the track retains the emotional weight and personal touch of the original melody.\n\nMy goal is to take something fundamentally human and amplify its impact through technology, creating tracks that are personal, immersive, but uniquely a product of my own direction - I'm hoping that stands out with my songs. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on this process (and I promise the word \"neon\" will never show up in any of my music).\n\nAlso, any feedback on the above track from my Soundcloud would always be appreciated!",

This creates a strong disconnect: the Reddit discussion suggests something absurd and experiential (likely experimental or avant-garde), but the actual track is a somber classical vocal work. Without being able to verify if this is the correct song match or listening to confirm the emotional content, I cannot confidently assign a sub-vibe.

They can go sad and dark though so you'd want to audition specific songs before opting for them.\n\nClannad might be a good choice too, with songs like \"Theme From Harry's Game\" (which is very pretty, but not in English) or \"In A Lifetime\", which features guest vocals from 80s Bono. (Of course Clannad leads one to think of Enya, but everybody is already familiar with Enya's stuff, right? Right ... ? Wait, how old am I again?)",

The Reddit comment recommends Italo Disco tracks from the 1980s (Grant Miller, Chris Luis, Savage, Danny Keith), which are European synth-based dance music.

Ko-Jo Cue creates contemporary African hip-hop, which is completely different from 80s European synth disco. This suggests either a validation error or the song was recommended in a different context not captured here.
