Some of their songs are marked with a C=64, which means those were created using no instruments other than a Commodore 64 console, so those are especially bloopy. The video you linked reminded me of [Space Oddity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQJdTDo0WE) in particular. You might like some of their other songs too, like [Ich habe in eine Zukunft gesehen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68mk5VfoRXo) (\"I've seen into a future\"). \n\nIf you're looking for instrumentals instead, you might like some songs by Dance With The Dead, like [Adrift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJyBcPu3K4).\n\nAlternatively, you could look for video game soundtracks, especially older ones. The [VVVVVV OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-baHj9N6dM) could fit what you're looking for. The [Dustforce OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXH5G_bqrlc) might be for you as well. (Unless you watch Chubbyemu on youtube. Then you might have a different association with some of those.)"

Enjoyable watch.\n\nScavengers Reign- wild animation, weird animals and biology strange universe.\n\nSeverance- Adam Scott lives separate work life and home life. One corporate slave, the other gets to live outside ignorant of what his job is at a nefarious corporation.\n\nServant- A mother loses her child and uses a baby doll to cope. Husband and brother allow the delusion. Mom hires a nanny who brings the baby to life. 4 seasons of WHAT THE FUCK. It’s a little messy sometimes but the cast and direction is wonderful.\n\nBooks, House of Leaves is a TRIP HUGE TRIP. \nThe Looking Glass Sound is a much shorter ride, slow burn but hits like a brick and unravels beautifully.\n\nA movie that is my silly recommendation because it sounds like you need light hearted, very creative and funny is Hundreds of Beavers. Go in knowing nothing is great. Just expect HIJINKS. ACME LEVEL HIJINKS.\n\nAnd authentically think you should see wicked sorry it’s obviously but it’s like medically prescribed for real."

Style is folk/country I'd say but worth a listen and can definitely end up having you in your feelings. Songs I Swore I'd Never Sing is a newer album but probably a good place to start and then trickle back to some of his older, rawer songs. Also his cover of Steve Earle's \"The Mountain\" on YT is great. Gives off a haunting vibe."

Your description of the genre is one of my favorite styles of music, so there's a lot that fits.  (And according to early definitions, even Led Zeppelin counted as metal, which... Yeah, I don't buy it either.)\n\nYou mentioned Zeppelin, but missed Kashmir. It starts a little stronger than a lot of these, but it does in fact go and explode into even more.\n\nThere's two Depeche Mode songs that do the synthesizer equivalent of this, \"Pimpf\" and \"Memphisto.\"  Pimpf is EXACTLY what you describe, a simple little piano bit that could be played on one hand, and then layers upon layers on top of it. Memphisto is similar, another piano intro with a bit more snythy-synths layering on top of it.\n\nGenesis did a few songs like this, The Brazilian is another with a bit stronger of an intro, but it also continues to build. One of my favorites as a kid. Then on that same album is \"Domino\" which has two parts, and ... the bridge between the two parts is what you describe. It sounds like a simple pop song, a la the Phil Collins solo era, but it then suddenly boom, part 2 is there. That entire album (The Invisible Touch) was one of my first albums as a kid, I'm just a huge fan, not a single on it that I didn't love.\n\nThen while we're talking about Phil Collins, you can't forget \"In the Air Tonight\" which is some sort of staple of that style of music, the tension builds in that and the breaks into some pure 80s. That song defined that era, it was so frequently played. :)\n\nThen we can pick Peter Gabriel (apparently not straying far from Genesis here), and he's got a large number songs like this. For example, \"The Heat\" definitely build and builds and builds and then... lets loose. I will listen to the soundtrack of Birdie, which is all Peter Gabriel songs done as instrumentals when I want something interesting to listen to that isn't distracting.\n\nWe'll go a little more modern, though not much, with Guns N Roses, with November Rain. And I mean, might as well do the other song that was on the radio at the time, we'll go with Dream On by Aerosmith.\n\nAnd lets get into the 2000s at least, and we'll add in \"I Will Possess Your Heart\" by Deathcab for Cutie, which is another slow slow build and while it doesn't crash, it does maintain that tension and ... Definitely a worthwhile inclusion.\n\nYou know, the more I think about it, the more this list could go on and on and on... :)  I'll let others type more, but you got me pulling out my spotify list."

It sounds like a simple pop song, a la the Phil Collins solo era, but it then suddenly boom, part 2 is there. That entire album (The Invisible Touch) was one of my first albums as a kid, I'm just a huge fan, not a single on it that I didn't love.\n\nThen while we're talking about Phil Collins, you can't forget \"In the Air Tonight\" which is some sort of staple of that style of music, the tension builds in that and the breaks into some pure 80s. That song defined that era, it was so frequently played. :)\n\nThen we can pick Peter Gabriel (apparently not straying far from Genesis here), and he's got a large number songs like this. For example, \"The Heat\" definitely build and builds and builds and then... lets loose. I will listen to the soundtrack of Birdie, which is all Peter Gabriel songs done as instrumentals when I want something interesting to listen to that isn't distracting.\n\nWe'll go a little more modern, though not much, with Guns N Roses, with November Rain. And I mean, might as well do the other song that was on the radio at the time, we'll go with Dream On by Aerosmith.\n\nAnd lets get into the 2000s at least, and we'll add in \"I Will Possess Your Heart\" by Deathcab for Cutie, which is another slow slow build and while it doesn't crash, it does maintain that tension and ... Definitely a worthwhile inclusion.\n\nYou know, the more I think about it, the more this list could go on and on and on... :)  I'll let others type more, but you got me pulling out my spotify list."

      "comment_text": "It's too bad you specify no metal, because \"Call of Ktulu\" is absolutely fitting. Your description of the genre is one of my favorite styles of music, so there's a lot that fits.  (And according to early definitions, even Led Zeppelin counted as metal, which... Yeah, I don't buy it either.)\n\nYou mentioned Zeppelin, but missed Kashmir. It starts a little stronger than a lot of these, but it does in fact go and explode into even more.\n\nThere's two Depeche Mode songs that do the synthesizer equivalent of this, \"Pimpf\" and \"Memphisto.\"  Pimpf is EXACTLY what you describe, a simple little piano bit that could be played on one hand, and then layers upon layers on top of it. Memphisto is similar, another piano intro with a bit more snythy-synths layering on top of it.\n\nGenesis did a few songs like this, The Brazilian is another with a bit stronger of an intro, but it also continues to build. One of my favorites as a kid. Then on that same album is \"Domino\" which has two parts, and ... the bridge between the two parts is what you describe. It sounds like a simple pop song, a la the Phil Collins solo era, but it then suddenly boom, part 2 is there. That entire album (The Invisible Touch) was one of my first albums as a kid, I'm just a huge fan, not a single on it that I didn't love.\n\nThen while we're talking about Phil Collins, you can't forget \"In the Air Tonight\" which is some sort of staple of that style of music, the tension builds in that and the breaks into some pure 80s.
