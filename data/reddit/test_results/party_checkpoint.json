They're all growing old anyway.  Does what they think really matter? Rather than shitting on a band and on their fans, maybe try promoting what you love without coming off as \"better than\". So what if you are? Some of us are naturally born smarter, etc, weather we work at it or not.  It doesn't matter that you have good taste, or that others have bad taste.  Share what you love, or don't share. No one wants to be shit on.  Not Creed, not anyone"

The way the song runs around your head is almost dizzying.\n\nBlack Dog - Feels like a punch you in the face rock song.  Until you realize the weird polyrhythmic thing it's doing in the drum and guitar groove.  \n\nWhen The Levee Breaks - The drum tone is UNREAL on this one.  It feels like the world is going to end.\n\nKashmir - The orchestra is such a nice touch.  \n\nFool in the Rain - The drummer (John Bonham) lays down the most amazing shuffle groove on this one.

Opinions exist especially with music so people actually CAN like songs that you don't! Maybe they have different music taste (crazy, I know). And since you asked why, in my OPINION some of their songs have good music and relatable lyrics. Disagree if you want but I'm not ashamed of liking them."

I've enjoyed their music for 6 years. I will admit that the first time I decided to listen to an entire album of theirs, I thought to myself: Wtf. It wasn't until I heard their last song of their Neotheater album that I knew this band was very different. While their music sounded like something I'd play at a child's party, their lyrics told a completely different story. I was drawn by their lyrics and then eventually by how they would compose songs. When that OKO album dropped, I knew that I was going to be an AJR fan for life. I would recommend you listen to their albums in order for each one tells a different story. However, if you don't want to listen to an entire album, I recommend you start with \"Finale (can't wait to see what you do next)\" because that is the song that made me change my opinion of them."

      "comment_text": "Depends on what I'm listening to. But I definitely have some specific songs/playlists I listen to in certain situations. I'm probably more particular about it than most people lol. Here are some of my playlists and when I ideally listen to them:\n\nClassic Rock #1 - Long drives (especially going north) when it's cloudy out. Any time of year but especially summer/fall\n\nClassic Rock #2 - Sitting somewhere with a north/east facing view on a sunny winter day in the mountains. I have yet to acheive this lol. But that's the goal someday. More often I listen to this one in the shower or while doing work\n\n90s/Melodic Rap - Originally made it for driving home from one of my old summer jobs, which would be around sunset. Just relaxed, good vibes. I don't drive much anymore but sometimes I pull it out on summer weekends\n\nIndie Folk - Very specific vibe, hard to describe but feels like what I think camping is like (never been camping lol). Listen to it almost exclusively at night in bed\n\nCountry Rock - Made for summer days in the South when I visit my grandma. Hard to explain but the soul/country twang just hits different when you're down there\n\nJazz/Lowkey Rap - Made for fall/winter nights and the vibe is very relaxed. Might be my favorite playlist of all. I imagine I'm sitting over a city at night when it's pitch black when I'm listening. Immaculate\n\nRain - I have a specific playlist for when it rains lol. It's literally called \"Rain\". Pretty short playlist but those songs all feel like when it's raining\n\nThat's a few of my many playlists.

Here's a few songs I think you should check outl:\n\n[Dance like it's your life](https://youtu.be/wurDLWQL5ow) <- Funky.  Very James Brown \"Get up offa that thing\" with a little Talking Heads synth sting.  \n\n[These are the days](https://youtu.be/_OXpzIxQgPM?list=OLAK5uy_mv3Q0We-b9R3HFvW-_5-Ho4WRsBgp1Upo) <- More 80s, with a very strong Talking Heads vibe in particular.  \n\n[Talkin Bout](https://youtu.be/F5inzYuzxu8) <- 80s New Wave\n\nTheir stuff is really fun.  Silly but also sometimes pretty poignant and absurdist.  \n\n**Scissor Sisters** might scratch your Disco vibe.  They aren't new, but are part of a 2000s era disco revival.  \n\n[Don't feel like Dancin'](https://youtu.be/4H5I6y1Qvz0).   \n\n[Take your mama](https://youtu.be/od7-fyGa9DQ) \n\n**Foxy Shazam**.    \n\nYour Glam suggestions are a little more serious than this but they might work for you.\n\n[Unstoppable](https://youtu.be/OFt3OqmGSbI)    \n\n[The Church of Rock and Roll](https://youtu.be/ErnUlBxq5bM)\n\n[Holy Touch](https://youtu.be/kgBKS4JCsec?t=60)\n\n**The Darkness**.  \n\nMaybe pushing a bit too far on the hair metal side of glam but worth a try\n\n[I believe in a thing called love](https://youtu.be/tKjZuykKY1I)."

They sold hundreds of millions of records. *Brothers In Arms* sold 30 million, making it one of the single best selling records of all time. Knopfler was seen as legitimate guitar god for his legendary playing style. And at one point, they were considered by some to arguably be *the* biggest band in the world.\n\n...and that was the moment they walked away.\n\nThe reason you don't see them discussed as much as other equally successful bands is because they decided to go on hiatus at their absolute peak. Not due to any drama or anything, just that it's extremely stressful to be in that position if that's not what you really set out to do. And the band themselves never wanted to hit that level of stardom again. They reunited for some shows, put out another album, and were eventually inducted into the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame, but they were not really about that life, so they sort of faded to the background of the collective consciousness.\n\nBut make no mistake, if you're a music nerd, you're probably a fan of Dire Straits. Just watch [the video of them playing \"Sultans of Swing\" at Alchemy Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pa9x9fZBtY) to see how much passion and fire and *fun* they have on stage. And how incredible they all are their crafts. You could probably show that one video to anyone who didn't take them seriously and change their mind immediately. And they have an incredibly deep discography, especially pre hiatus. \n\nDefinitely a band worth diving into."
