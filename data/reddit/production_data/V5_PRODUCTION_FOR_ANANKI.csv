As with many of Maynard's songs, this tackles his mother's unwavering piousness in the face of her disability, and his cynicism towards it. It's climax is unrelenting. I was also tempted to recommend The Noose by A Perfect Circle (another of his bands) which deals with similar themes.

Josh Ritter - Dreams

Bit more folky than the rest, this one looks at depression. His lyrical prowess is on display here - the imagery is incredible. He hasn't really done any others like it.

The Decemberists - The Island...

One of those breaking the mould prog tracks from a classically folk outfit - this is a retelling of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Joan in the Garden is their other similar track.

Typhoon - Ariadne

The closer on a brilliant album about spiralling dementia - dark, brooding and wonderfully orchestral. If you like it... the whole album is a journey to it I'd recommend taking. And their other albums (although less brooding). I could wax lyrical all day tbh.

As with many of Maynard's songs, this tackles his mother's unwavering piousness in the face of her disability, and his cynicism towards it. It's climax is unrelenting. I was also tempted to recommend The Noose by A Perfect Circle (another of his bands) which deals with similar themes.

Porcupine Tree - Anesthetize

Slow building and dark, this song captures individual loneliness and mental struggle in the midst of a fractured, cathode-drowned society. If you like it, I'd recommend Russia on Ice for it's slow build, or shesmoviedon for it's perfect solo.

Manchester Orchestra - The Silence

Slow building and powerful - an introspective look at escaping the shackles of genetic inheritance. Andy Hull's vocals are, a bit like Jeff's, mesmerising and overwhelming in their beauty. Other songs I'd recommend are Rear View and Dinosaur.

Josh Ritter - Dreams

Bit more folky than the rest, this one looks at depression. His lyrical prowess is on display here - the imagery is incredible. He hasn't really done any others like it.

The Decemberists - The Island...

One of those breaking the mould prog tracks from a classically folk outfit - this is a retelling of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Joan in the Garden is their other similar track.

Typhoon - Ariadne

The closer on a brilliant album about spiralling dementia - dark, brooding and wonderfully orchestral. If you like it... the whole album is a journey to it I'd recommend taking. And their other albums (although less brooding). I could wax lyrical all day tbh.

Hope you like these!"

If you've never heard their music, the best way I can describe it is that to me it sounds like music from a movie about a pagan cult. Woodsy, dark, haunting.

Their whole Dear Wormwood album is inspired by CS Lewis’s writing so you’ll definitely get a lot of religious allusions and undertones there. 

A lot of Twenty One Pilots songs also deal with struggling with belief I feel like? Songs like Doubt, Trees, and Implicit Demand for Proof fit that although they’re not acoustic. 

Old Time Religion by Parker Millsap is about misinterpreting the Bible and is more folksy sounding. 

Radical Face is one of my favorite artists and might have some stuff here as well? Check out the songs Sisters and Holy Branches to start."

Bon Iver - 22, A Million is a tour de force in music production and layering of sounds. A crowning achievement of a record that I don't think he'll eclipse.

Villagers is brilliant for pushing boundaries and blending genres - lots of piano, strings and electronic sampling mixed in. Sometimes sounds timeless, sometimes like house music. Connor really broke from his acoustic folk sound from his earliest album and seems to be doing what he wants beyond the confines of genre.

Those are three that spring to mind on the topic of 'textured' music. I could offer a lot more but you're going to get a lot of recommendations so I'll hold off."

Someone recently told me about this song, and it's soooo awesome!!!!

It's an absolutely unique blend of different vocals, rap without the annoying hi-hat, and wonderful instrumentals. Extremely dynamic, never boring. Doja Cat's vocals absolutely shine through full of life, without being boxed in by intense music.

Absolutely love how the music is so powerful but not overbearing.

Very good.

I might suggest :

Magnolia ( 1999 )
21 Grams ( 2003 )
Both ensemble cast, slice of lives interacting style movies in the style of Crash ( 2004 )

Mysterious Skin ( 2004 ).  Shares an unpleasant theme with Happiness, so consider that a trigger warning.

Leaving Las Vegas (1995 ). Intense romance? Check.  Devastating and depressing? Check. Dark Subject matter? Oh, dear, there's a lot of that. A very unflattering portrait of addiction. ""Mike Figgis' “Leaving Las Vegas” (1995) is not a love story, although it feels like one, but a story about two desperate people using love as a form of prayer and a last resort against their pain.""

Synechdoche, New York ( 2008 ). ""Charlie Kaufman’s directorial debut is either a masterpiece or a massively dysfunctional act of self-indulgence"".  Sounds right up your street :-)


Saint Maud ( 2019 ). Advertised as horror but more pychologically creepy. Weird and ominous and dark.  Good times!


Anything directed by Gaspar Noé would probably be a good suggestion for you but I'll go with Climax ( 2018 ) which I found mesmerising and disturbing. Other mentions by him would be Irreversible ( 2002,  the best movie I will never watch again, serious trigger warnings for that one, eeek )  or Enter The Void ( 2009, a really hard watch due to subject matter and technique but it's unique and horrifying and something that I will always remember).



I see you like some Park Chan-wook too. I'm a big fan of dark Korean crime thrillers so if you fancy some of those let me know."

You should really listen to Kendrick’s “Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers” album too. The whole album is about self reflection and healing through therapy. Also, I’m aware a lot of these songs on this list don’t really qualify as “happy” music - but they’re all in someway or another talking about mental health and as someone who’s been down on his luck himself, these were some songs that would me help keep my head above water. Unrelated but if you ever need someone to reach out to or talk to, I’m all ears! Best of luck to you, music saved my life and is some of the best therapy out there!"

I don't know if my response aligns with the music's tone perfectly, as much as I select music that doesn't emotionally clash too hard with my state. So, being chronically depressed, drone/ambient, doom metal, and stoner metal seems to work for me pretty much any time.

While her contemporaries excel at all the things you mentioned, Swift has succeeded in mediocrity. She is simply the best at being bland. And that has wide range appeal. 

From what I can tell, the themes she writes songs about that people resonate with are the most common denominator themes for people whose height of identity and social interaction was in high school. She has essentially created an image that tells her fans “See? You too can become wildly successful and famous without having to be particularly interesting or talented in any way!” I think this creates a sense of both comfort and possibility in her fans. 

Simply put, the majority of people are relatively unremarkable, and Swift has cornered the market in being unremarkable. I think from this last album we can tell that it’s a numbers game. Her defenders say “the album charted” but that doesn’t mean it’s good; when consumption is easily digestible for the masses and the masses have poor taste that is going to equate to massive popularity."

This phenomenon came to mind re-reading a book I have on the Kinks.

Animal Collective - Sung Tongs - all their albums vary wildly in sound, but the core of what makes Animal Collective Animal Collective really gets laid down here - the harmonies, the noisy and busy production, and calling on 60s/70s pop melodies gets put together here fully, whereas prior releases only dabbled in one or two aspects of what would become their sound.

King Gheedorah - Take Me to Your Leader - the first ""MF DOOM"" (if you can call it that) that to me really feels like a DOOM album, even if he only raps on two songs on it. However, this is where his production really comes into its own, and the sound collages and the sources he samples from here are the beginnings of quintessential DOOM. KMD sounded completely different, and Operation Doomsday, although solid, is only the beginning of him fleshing out his post-KMD sound, you can see the ideas that defined DOOM but I'd argue it doesnt get realized til this release.

Earl Sweatshirt - Some Rap Songs - all his releases up til this album have been getting closer to hinting in the direction this album would take, but after this came out, Earl has firmly settled in his niche and owns it. Plus, it seems like every release he's made after is treading the same ground Some Rap Songs established."

Hardcore Coldplay fan here, especially of Chris, so I thought I'd put  in my 2 cents. I'll just recommend 2 things if you really want to understand better how Chris ""works"" and how he became who he is:

* Pete Holmes' podcast ""You Made It Weird"" with Chris as a guest, September 2021. Chris talks in great lengths about what fuels/fuelled him to become who he is, and his relationship with fame.
* The A Head Full of Dreams documentary made by Mat Whitecross in 2018.

These will explain better than me that talent really hasn't got anything to do with fame, first and foremost. If you really get into Coldplay and their philosophy nowadays (since the last 5 albums I'd say), you get to see that despite the whole rock star thing and despite all the weirdness one might see in him, Chris is probably the most down to earth and human person I know of. That is ultimately what I am fascinated about and what helps them ""own"" every stadium they play to."

\###

In 1966, Kinks frontman and songwriter Ray Davies was at a creative crossroads. Though the Kinks were always seen in popular culture as the natural competitor to fellow Brits the Beatles, Davies didn’t see himself as McCartney, Lennon, Harrison, or Starr.

In his mind, he was Brian Wilson. And the Kinks were capable of becoming the Beach Boys.

My hope in posting this was that I'd get thoughtful responses to pressure test my ideas, so thank you for that!

I think my big takeaway is that I think I've overstated the prevalence of the negative aspects of nostalgia I see in the overarching themes of ""Village Green."" While I do still believe he's generally skeptical of nostalgia, based in large part on where he was artistically at the time and constraints he felt himself under while writing ""VG,"" perhaps I'd be more accurate in saying that the album is a meditation on nostalgia in general - both the good and the bad.

That's where I think ""Do You Remember Walter"" and ""Johnny Thunder"" come in. ""Johnny"" is the quintessential tall tale that gets told in small town (having grown up in one myself, I know these well). Meanwhile, I do see some of the themes I discussed cropping up in ""Walter:""

*""And you're always home in bed by half past eight.*  
*And if I talked about the old times, you'd get bored*  
*And you'd have nothing more to say.""*

I think we see two sides of the same coin in this song: On one, the narrator who yearns for the past and to relive old memories, and with Walter we have someone who has moved on. The narrator wants Walter to be someone he isn't anymore - nor does Walter have any interest in being again.

(Let me add here, I promise I didn't omit mentioning either song because it didn't fit my argument. I just didn't thinking listing every song would make for a very compelling read, so I called out what I thought were the most interesting examples.)

Now, on the ""Steam Powered Train,"" I think we disagree a little more distinctly.

*""In terms of how it fits into the album it's saying that Davies as a musician can ""live in a museum.""*

Davies was roughly 22 when this album was written, and he was experiencing a well-documented artistic rut caused by his perceived limitations of the Kinks' sound. He was an open fan of Brian Wilson's more limit-pushing instrumentation and wante"

Eh, I guess lol America nowadays makes me pretty sad overall. I think we're declining and crumbling as a country if I'm being honest.
