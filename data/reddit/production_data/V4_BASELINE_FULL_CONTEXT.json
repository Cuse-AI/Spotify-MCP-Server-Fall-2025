I'm curious which albums and artists others would recommend within free jazz that are along these lines, stuff that doesn't cross the line into excess.",

    "selftext": "Probably a thousand posts like this per week, but I'm in a weird place musically and would love some good recs. I'll describe the kind of thing I like right now, list some of my current favourite jazz albums, and mention what I like about them.\n\nAs the title suggests, I've been really enjoying this high energy, avant-garde live jam type of album. I'm looking for stuff with some deep grooves, maybe some improvisational structure but lots of attention to detail. Think fusion-era Miles Davis live albums. I'm okay with fusion, bebop, third stream, hard bop, anything. I'm open to classics, obscure, new, old. Here are a few of my current favourites:\n\n\n\nCharles Mingus - The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady  \nPretty obvious pick. Love the smoky, emotional, progressive nature of this.\n\nCharles Mingus - Right Now (live)  \nThis is a close second for my Mingus pick. So explosive, weird, and powerful.\n\nMiles Davis - Dark Magus (live)  \nThe constant, building energy and improv is so perfect on this. Such a musical tour-de-force. (HM: Bitches Brew)\n\nSun Ra - Sleeping Beauty  \nI haven't heard much Sun Ra, but I love this one. I love the layeredness and mysterious quality to much of the composition.\n\nPharoah Sanders - Karma  \nThere are definitely elements I don't love to this one (notably the vocals), but I could listen to the first 60 seconds of this thing for the rest of my life. I'd LOVE anything that sounds like this one (I also haven't touched any other projects by Sanders. I'd love some suggestions) I love the rich, gorgeous instruments on here.\n\nPeter Brotzmann - Machine Gun  \nI got into this one recently. Very cool. I like the constant intensity.\n\nAnything by Frank Zappa (especially Weasels Ripped My Flesh and The Grand Wazoo)\n\n\n\nI'll reply to any standout recommendations, and give everything a shot. Thanks so much!",

I'm looking for a very particular sound and here are my two best examples:\n\nJeru by Miles Davis (birth of the cool recording)  \n[This ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAEIwVTBLN8)live cut of Count Basie's Orchestra playing Blue and Sentimental\n\nthe slightly off pitch feel is what I like. Props if its got a bluesy feel. I generally want some larger ensemble music to get that varied effect across so many horns, preferably classics, I've thought of Mingus' black saint but it doesn't quite fit. Maybe it does... but the two songs I mentioned are certainly closer.\n\nAny recommendations appreciated!\n\nThanks\n\nedit: fixed link!

    "selftext": "I'm a giant Coltrane fan (aren't we all?) and, while I like more-or-less everything he was involved in, my current obsession is with his recordings towards the end of the classic quartet period.\n\nI'm finding it hard to put into words exactly what is tickling my fancy, but I think it's some combination of the following:\n\n* Coltrane's output at this time was increasingly \"free\" but still clearly grounded in what he had recorded before (hard-bop, modal jazz, etc.)\n* While the solos are no longer strictly following changes (or sticking to certain modes) they are clearly grounded in the jazz tradition and use a fair amount of jazz vocabulary\n* The rhythm section can also be fairly wild, relative to some other jazz recordings of the period or earlier, but it's not quite the insanity one expects from what is usually labelled free jazz.\n* Still, Coltrane's solos are often wild (in the best way).\n\nExamples of records I'm currently enjoying are *First meditations* and *Sun Ship*.  I think *Meditations* would fall into my category too, although this wasn't just the quartet.\n\nA lot of free jazz moves far enough away from the jazz tradition that it probably should (and often does, e.g. much European free jazz) get it's own label, like \"improvised music\".  I like plenty of free jazz & there are many threads on this subreddit giving free jazz recommendations (a lot of which I like) but this isn't quite what I'm looking for.  I guess I'm looking for \"not quite free jazz but with crazy solos\" or \"free jazz with a clear grounding in jazz tradition\" or something?\n\n Anyway, I thought I'd throw that out there and see what people suggest.  I'm sure I'll have heard some of the recommendations, but look forward to hearing about new stuff (and appreciate any and all recommendations).",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI'm looking for music that fits an approach I'm really interested in as a music listener and an experimental musician.\n\nI would define what I'm looking for as music that embraces a weird, unhinged, over the top aesthetic, that borders on the comical and parodic side, but that has a strong emotional core to it, an intensity and sincerity in its execution.\n\nI guess this could include very noisy and experimental stuff, but also really far out outsider music, or anything really.\n\nI have a few examples to share below, but I'm not sure this list is complete enough to convey what I'm looking for and my definition still feels unclear.\n\nExamples :\n\n'for parker nina and my range rover' by Jalen\n\n[https://youtu.be/V7FF8tfgscs?si=sHHncJDPKcMWaVEh](https://youtu.be/V7FF8tfgscs?si=sHHncJDPKcMWaVEh)\n\n'Me and Mrs Jones' by Sun City Girls\n\n[https://youtu.be/LCmSSN8aZ3s?si=sqkT-BArkC95kUnt](https://youtu.be/LCmSSN8aZ3s?si=sqkT-BArkC95kUnt)\n\nI was looking into more examples and couldn't really find any other without having to spend an hour searching into my archives, if I find something worth it I'll post it here.\n\nAny recommendation is welcome !!!\n\nFeel free to share songs, albums or even try to help me put words on these loose ideas !!!\n\n  \nEDIT\n\nI have listened to a few of what you sent me thanks a lot for the nice music this is a lot more than what I expected !!!\n\nThere are a few things that fit what I'm looking for. In what I've seen mentionned I'd say the biggest ones are Xiu Xiu, Animal Collective (depending on the album but generally think of their wierder and harsher stuff), John Frusciante's Niandra la Des album, the Residents even though I don't really find the emotional part that present. I haven't had the time to listen to most of the things mentionned here so there might be really great things regarding the topic that I haven't checked yet.\n\nHere's an example of what I want, this is an album I made myself, it's made of loops of improvised vocals. I tried to be really physically involved, make stuff funny, strange, extreme, but also dramatic and touching. There is in the intentions a lot of self-parody regarding my autistic stims, my sexuality and gender expression, the music I listen to. It is very seriously silly.\n\n[https://youtu.be/ssZbcVHkdPc?si=59jToqPx3\\_LMI3np](https://youtu.be/ssZbcVHkdPc?si=59jToqPx3_LMI3np)\n\nI think one thing I didn't mention that appeared to me listening to certain of your recommendations is the importance of the voice. I think what I want is really anchored in physical self-expression, therefore vocals. I seem to have cited mostly artists that have a very unusual vocal delivery, really accentuated traits, emphatic expression.\n\nInfinitely thank you my friends !!!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m on the lookout for new jazz albums and hoping to discover some great recommendations for lesser-known jazz musicians through this post.\n I’ve been listening to jazz intensively for almost a year now, and I really like jazz. I’ve already explored a lot of the classics from the 1950s onward, and I’m familiar with the work of legends like Mingus, Coltrane, Davis, Tyner, Hubbard, Hancock, Morgan, Shorter, Henderson, Rollins, and many others.\n\nDuring my journey, though, I also came across a few relatively unknown artists who absolutely blew me away. Billy Harper, for instance, I find to be of exceptional quality, though he doesn’t have the same level of recognition as the big names. Albums like Black Saint, In Europe, and Knowledge of Self are truly phenomenal and, in my opinion, deserve a much larger audience. Clifford Jordan’s Glass Bead Games is another masterpiece that I keep coming back to. Freddie Redd's Shades of Redd is also amazing.\n\nWhen it comes to contemporary jazz, I think Melissa Aldana really stands out. Her playing moves me deeply, and I feel she is truly in a league of her own.\n\nSo my question to you is: which jazz musicians do you follow who might be lesser-known or underrated? I’d love to hear your suggestions!\n\n\n……….….…………………\n\nUpdate:\nThe response has been incredible, and I’d like to take this moment to thank everyone who recommended musicians and albums in the comments. I’m excited about discovering so many new artists. Now, I’m going to organize everything and dive into all this new jazz music.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Enough with Letterboxd and everyone’s top 4 movies; let’s discuss our top 4 Artists/Bands.\n\nList your top 4 Artists but for each state their general genre(s), a brief statement why they’re a fav of yours, your favorite album/EP and/or song by them, and a song/album that you would recommend to someone isn’t into or doesn’t know the artist.\n\nMy Top 4:\n\n1. Lady Gaga (Pop, Dance-pop). Her versatility is a force to be reckoned with; she’s gotten me to listen to and enjoy genres I normally wouldn’t be into or check out. She’s the total package; strong lyricist/songwriter, great producing ability, an amazing vocalist, trained musician, a skilled dancer, a refreshing and hypnotic persona and sense of style. And no one can do a music video like she does. If her artistry and music wasn’t enough, her strive and what she stands for make her iconic as well.\n\nFavorite Album = Born This Way, ARTPOP is close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Abracadabra, shows off the theatricality, strength, and versatility of her voice while exuding the weird and catchy lyricism that is part of her niche. And the production is immaculate and classic dance/synth Gaga.\n\nRecommended Album = ARTPOP or Mayhem, both are quintessential Gaga and have something for everybody on them.\n\n2. Young the Giant (Indie/Alternative Pop/Rock). They literally can’t make a bad song. The lead singer has the voice of an angel and it’s unique. Their melodies, production, and lyrics are a mood and matched with Sameer’s heavenly vocals, they entrance you. And with a signature style/sound all their albums sound different and have different sonic elements and themes.\n\nFavorite Album = Home of the Strange, Mirror Master is a close 2nd\n\nRecommended Song = Call Me Back, shows off Sameer’s vocals and exemplifies their sound/style and lyrical content.\n\nRecommended Album = Home of the Strange, a perfect showcase of their sound, their lyrical themes, and Sameer’s vocals. Has many of their best songs and music videos.\n\n3. Kid Cudi (Alternative Hip-hop, Melodic Rap). His music has great and addictive atmosphere and he really knows how to create a wonderful vibe through melodic beats, introspective and cosmic/spiritual lyrics, and his unique and eclectic vocal stylings and performance. He’s in a league of his own and that has made he so influential and so resonating.\n\nFavorite Album = Man On the Moon III: The Chosen\n\nRecommended Song = Just What I Am, the hypnotic and atmospheric melody and production he is known for, paired with his central lyrical themes and signature vocals/flow.\n\nRecommended Album = Man on the Moon series (1, 2, or 3), the trilogy best represents him and has most of his best and iconic work.\n\n4. Majid Jordan (Alternative R&B, Synthwave/pop). They make magic together. Deep bouncy and raving production, serenading soulful and emotional vocals, and decadent romantic lyrics; they’re a perfect R&B duo. They move me with their music in multiple ways lol.\n\nFavorite Album = Wildest Dreams\n\nRecommended Song = Something About You, classic Majid Jordan. Emotive and strong vocals from Majid, minimalistic but enchanting production from Jordan, and their signature affectionate lyrics. \n\nRecommended Album = A Place Like This - EP or Wildest Dreams, both are essential Majid Jordan and prominent work in their discography.",

    "selftext": "i remember i downloaded an album of maybe 4 tracks made by this guy, consisting of looping some bass-oriented strings, chamber music  i guess. melancholic, ambient, made me think of an awesome sight like a busy sea slightly in slow motion. idk if there was violin in it or it was bass + cello, it was layered enough. my favorite track was a simple loop going on and on for a minute or 2, sounding like \"tee , taa taa taa taa teee taa\" then a kind of bass heavier \"inversion\" going once then the loop started again, something like that.\n\ni don't know if it was a \"contemporary classical\" composer that used loops, a minimalist composer or an electronic musician using samples. going tru a list of musicians i am familiar with or not that released stuff in those years.\n\nthe loop was done in a  \"primitive\" / \"naive\" way and very minimalist. maybe it was from a musique concrete composer that use tapes.  i listened to this between 2000 and  2004 , i think it was made around that time.",

I think the AllMusic review of this album by David Adler really sums it up perfectly ([The Colours of Chloë -  AllMusic](https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-colours-of-chlo%C3%AB-mw0000196717)) - *\"Eberhard Weber's first record remains his most well-known and influential. An ambitious work of what might be called symphonic jazz, The Colours of Chloë helped to define the ECM sound—picturesque, romantic, at times rhythmically involved, at others minimalistic and harmonically abstruse... People will disagree about whether \"The Colours of Chloë\" stands the test of time, but Weber's aesthetic played a significant role in the creative music of the '70s, attracting a fair share of emulators.\"*\n\nLet us know what you think!

I know it's a little late, but I would love to add to my mix, if anyone is feeling this sentiment and wants to add a suggestion or two.\n\n\n\nFor me, this time of year feels bright and jangly, kind of trippy, somewhere between upbeat folk and electronic, with a healthy does of punk and jazz thrown in. But don't let me tell you what the holidays should feel like, I want to hear what they feel like to you!\n\n\n\nThe first EP from Air, before Moon Safari, is definitely holiday music for me. As is Pet Sounds by The Beach Boys, and The Soft Bulletin by The Flaming Lips.\n\n\n\nThis is just for music that is NOT Christmas music. I'm going to post a thread tomorrow looking for your favorite obscure Christmas songs. Stay tuned.",

I need songs that will make me think of buttermilk biscuits in a cast iron skillet and homemade blueberry moonshine. Songs that sound like they were recorded in an old, creaky cabin! I also love songs that contain the fiddle and banjo. Thank you.",

    "selftext": "I absolutely love self-proclaimed cyberpunk music: Zombie Hyperdrive, LukHash, OGRE Sound, and Waveshaper are a few of my favorites. What appeals to me most is the futuristic sound, the synths, the heavy beats, and the generally upbeat nature. It makes me feel like I'm a hacker in a Shadowrun setting.\n\nThe tone of the music, song & album names, and album covers are generally rather dark. *Robot Uprising*? *Negotiation's Over*? In the music itself, there's a lot of gun or weapon sounds, along with police sirens. It's pretty epic and gives me energy for writing gritty sci-fi.\n\nHowever, I'm working on a project that is much more hopeful. I think it might be considered solarpunk. I looked for music using that term and didn't find much. Most of what I've found was either hopeful but very slow and ambient or as I mentioned earlier, upbeat and futuristic but very dark. I want something that sounds futuristic, upbeat, and hopeful at the same time.\n\nI apologize if I used any music terms incorrectly. My limited musical education only includes chorus in high school.\n\nThank you in advance.",

In the realm of rock music, a lot of what was considered innovation was in the realm of the studio. Read the Wikipedia articles on the Beach Boys' Smile or Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland to see what I'm talking about. I'm a big fan of this, the studio experimentation seen in Brian Eno's 70s albums or the Beatles post Rubber Soul albums has always fascinated me. To my understanding, jazz innovation is more in the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic sense - that is, in the music rather than in the environment that created it. I'm probably wrong, but I believe most jazz records were recorded by a bunch of musicians in a room, playing live, and then it gets mixed and mastered? Again, the real genius was in the chord progressions, syncopations, and melodic experimentation. But I'm wondering if there are any jazz records that \"use the studio as an instrument\"? I'm really curious to see ways these artists might have utilized the new technology erupting out of the 60s and onward. ",

Most of these genres I’m unfamiliar with, and need help adding to and bettering the playlist.\n\nI’m kinda asking for two things:\n\n1: New genres to add (please include genre name and song)\nOr\n2: Changes to current genres and songs.\n\n\nI do wanna avoid adding genres that are [Country Demonym] + Genre. I feel like that would bloat the playlist and I don’t think language always changes the genre. I think there are exceptions to this rule, as you’ll see in my Google doc.\n\nLastly. Please don’t hateful about any of my picks. This isn’t really my wheelhouse. I just wanna be exposed to more music.\n\n(I’m using Spotify. I didn’t share the playlist since my Spotify name is my legal name. I’ll fix that once I feel the playlist is ready and I’ll repost it here)",

We both have a band and a DJ. \n\nOur band is a tribute band that takes requests and obviously the dj can play whatever we want. \n\nThe alcohol is flowing, everybody is close friends or related, so the roof must be blown off!  \nWhich songs do you believe will make everyone dance, regardless of age, heritage, etc?\n\nI am very curious about your suggestions :)",

Sometimes there's decent stuff like [DJ Tiesto - He's a Pirate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7JA2ucniMk) which is pretty nice\n- Indian+(Psy)Trance/Goa/etc: lots out there, so skip\n- Trance + Mongolian Throat Singing: idk why, but it seems all Mongolians make is trance music\n- Nasheeds also have lots of Techno/Trap remixes \n\n(Black) Metal + Soul\n\n- anything from Zeal & Ardor, [Don't You Dare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVqgI5HY3js) is a classic\n\nMetal + Folk\n\n- Indian: anything from Bloodywood, [Gaddaar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iKjSCTxke8) is a banger\n- there should be lots of gems in this genre, so if there's anything nice, pls let me know\n\nMetal + Metal\n\n- Power Death Metal: [Dragoncorpse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ex8NWeMpgM)\n\nRock + Folk\n\n- Japanese: anything from Wagakki Band, [Senbonzakura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_xTet06SUo) is probably most known\n\nCrazy guitar stuff\n\n- not really mixing genres, but more like playing a different genre on guitar\n- [Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5NoQg8LdDk) (mostly hiphop/rap), [Syncatto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW-f6h9cosI) (Tango, Flamenco, random stuff), [Furia De Pantera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwriWcssf_k)\n\nRap/Hiphop + Folk\n\n- Mongolian Throat Singing: [Ethnic Zorigoo ft Zaya - Khuleg baatar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el93MIxAf-c)\n- Yodel\n  - [Caparezza - Jodellavitanonhocapitouncazzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaXuMC_GHEE)\n  - [The Yodeling Gangster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvkXMtSWpNs)\n- Japanese (shamisen): \n  - [Yoshida Brothers - Kodo (Inside the Sun Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jesn_ko6Shc)\n  - [Rhymester - HEAT ISLAND](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0n5xWwJwxs)\n- Sutra: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV6VyvAHOdg\n- Cattle Auctions (lol): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLhLgaBCD90\n\nFolk + Folk\n\n- Mongolian + Bagpipes: [Hunnu Guren - Batzorig Vaanchig & Auli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vztRqe_CHC0)\n\nMisc\n\n- (Metal + Military snare drums?) love the drums in this part: https://youtu.be/LqEz76p-H40?t=98\n- (Death Metal + Saxophone) [Rivers of Nihil - Where Owls Know My Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBAXZto7uVc)\n- (Acid + Digeridoo) [Aphex Twin - Digeridoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5UBYOv1G9A)",

A couple albums I love right now are “They Left Me With A Gun” by Paris Texas, “Justified” by Justin Timberlake, “When I Get Home” by Solange, and “Pressure” by Julia Wolf. My favorite albums of all time are “In Search Of” by N.E.R.D, “All Eyez On Me” by 2pac, and “thank u, next” by Ariana Grande. I enjoy experimental sound, funky drums/ synth, and exquisite vocals/ lyricism. I love many genres, but gravitate towards R&B, hip hop, 90s rock/alternative, 90s/2000s pop, and numetal. I’ve also been enjoying Afrobeats, Arabic pop, and Latin dance lately and would love some international suggestions. WEWIL?",

    "selftext": "Okay so here are some songs and *why* i like them, hopefully this helps.\n\n\n\nOnly in Dreams by Weezer : i love the slow buildup with the bassline.. To a perfect solo. The lyrics are also super fucking touching.\n\n\n\nForget Her by Jeff Buckley : His voice is one of the best i have ever heard, the raw emotion is incredible, the lyrics are extremely relatable.\n\n\n\nLimousine by Brand New : i love when bands move away from their respective subgenres to create longer pieces of music that take you on a journey. Limousine is long, but it builds up to one of my favorite climaxes ever. Jesse Lacey's vocals are incredible.\n\n  \nThe Same Deep Water As You by The Cure : Robert Smith is master lyricist and a great vocalist, but what i like even more in this song is the atmosphere that's being built. It's hands down by favorite song on disintegration.\n\n\n\nNew Dawn Fades by Joy Division : Ian Curtis' lyrics helped me through some of my darkest times. But when it comes to New Dawn Fades it's every single part of the track that moves me. Every instrument has a thing to say and it feels dry and dead but at the same time extremely emotional, idk how to describe it lol.\n\n  \nBroken Again by Blade and Bath : Been getting into DSBM lately and i love how it's not just the regular trope of low quality potato produced black metal. It's actual people writing about depressing experiences that connect with you and i feel like Broken Again is the perfect representation of that.\n\n  \nyour recommendations don't need to resemble all of these songs at once, i will take anything you guys have that resembles any one of the tracks i mentioned.",

Not really into diss tracks, pervy tunes, or gang stuff (unless it's more reflective instead of glorifying).\n\nSome solo artists I enjoy are Lupe Fiasco, Kid Cudi, and Macklemore. I like how a lot of their songs express appreciation for their stardom, or genuine self criticism, or fine tuned social or political commentary. It feels intellectual and mature. \n\nA couple groups I've been getting into include Black Eyed Peas, Wu Tang Clan, Reflection Eternal, and Tribe Called Quest. \n\nI'll take suggestions from bigger artists or more underground artists. Please give a couple example songs when you recommend.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: here's a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ziNIHhlR1XBNdEOgB33od?si=hvIOvLiJQX6ZynFpHvA0bA) I've got going so far.

This has inevitably reminded me that life is short and finite, and that it would be good to accompany my days with songs I don’t know—songs recommended by people who know more about music than I do.\n\nAlthough I’m a music enthusiast, I recently went through my Spotify playlists and realized they’re quite short. I’d like to expand them.\n\nI suppose what I usually appreciate in a song is being able to find beauty in it, or that it leads me to think about or question something about the world I live in.\n\nMaybe that’s a very broad request, but I’m open to all kinds of recommendations, regardless of genre or the year the song was made.\n\nSo, if you have any specific song suggestions or full Spotify playlists, I’d really appreciate it.",

I’m not religious, so I’m not really looking for “they’re in a better place” kinda vibes, just something to give words to how I’m feeling. It’s also complicated because we weren’t the closest, but I just thought we’d have time to fix things.\n\nI’m not sure if that all makes much sense, but I appreciate in advance any recommendations you’ve got for me <3",

That’s why I want to find something for the next time I feel such a way. Plus, that emptiness feeling from such music sometimes just gives me a happier viewpoint on life afterwards, as it ends up cancelling it out sometimes.\n\nNow, “sad” music is something that varies a lot from person to person, and I understand that. For me, I need it to be quite experimental. Chord progression is a very important thing in this case. It can’t be anything crazy mainstream because I’ve probably heard it before. I like stuff with almost a “drone-ish” feel to it, possibly powerful harsh frequency’s that are just a crush to the soul. Usually the longer the song the better too. I know that these are some very odd requests, and that some may think I’m just describing soundtracks for the blind by swans (which is also an AMAZING album) but I gotta find something. If you have anything kinda different from what I stated but you still greatly believe it to be soul crushing, you may still send it as I trust you guys. And if you have any questions, that’s good to.

So that's why I went to Youtube and wrote to the search bar \"sad music for taking a shit\" and \"music for going to toilet\", but I couldn't find sad music specifically for taking a shit and I felt like my world crashed down. \"How can I now take a shit\"? \"I don't have anything that matches my bad mood+ the atmosphere of the toilet. So that's why I came here to Reddit to ask you guys to recommend me sad music for taking a shit, because I still need to shit really badly. But without matching sad music it feels really overwhelming and like there's no point. PLEASE HELP ME I NEED TO SHIT RIGHT NOW!! WHAT SHOULD I DO???",

Music was a huge part of his life and while I’d honestly prefer to listen to his favorite music, we haven’t gotten his phone back from the police yet so I’m shit out of luck in that aspect. I just really need to allow myself to feel something and music is the only way I know how to find that type of release. Please give me song suggestions or a playlist I could listen to. \n\nThank you \n\nedit: wow. thank you all for much for the outpouring support and suggestions. much love to you all. 🖤\n\nedit 2: i’m genuinely shocked that this is still blowing up. i really appreciate each and every one of you. thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Maybe i’ve listened to too much music, gathering as i have  over 5000 liked songs on spotify. Music just doesn’t make me feel the same as it used to. I used to connect with it on a deep emotional level with almost every listen. Now it’s just become sort of background noise that feels like it’s grating on my ears. Or when i listen to new music at least that spotify reccomends me. I feel like im in a music rut and I NEED to get out of it.\n\nIdk maybe its the spotify algorithm that keeps reccomending me the same 20 songs that i already know or songs that sound similar to ones ive already liked. Most of my reccomended songs sound like the same indie slop vaguely reminiscent of clairo and every other big indie pop artist.\n\nMaybe its the fact that i usually listen to music while doing other stuff, cleaning, commuting, cooking etc. Maybe i need to find a new way of listening to music.\n\nMaybe i need to listen to older music instead of  new releases but i refuse to believe that there isnt good music anymore i just think theres an abundance of artists and it’s easy to get lost in all that art and feel overwhelmed.\n\nIf you guys have any recommendations on what to do to enjoy listening to music again and connecting with it PLEASEEEE let me know. \n\nMy favorite artists are as follows: Nothing but thieves (their first 2 albums specifically 🫶🏻) , Mitski, Radiohead, Inhaler, Chappell Roan, Lola young, Weyes Blood, Kate Bush, flower face, billie marten, Nina Simone, Jeff buckley\n\nWhat i really like about these artists is the emotional intensity of the music, lyricism, and some element of smth unexpected in the instrumentals or vocals.\n\n\nP.S the recs can be completely different to what i already like (preferably even). \n\nP.P.S go listen to Heather Smith on spotify (the brunette one) I found her music through the comments and her story and her music really touched me!!! shes so talented!! \n\nalso as a finn im loving the amount of nightwish recommendations. my favorite band as a kid getting the love it deserves LETS GOOO ",

    "selftext": "I mean literally disturbed and made you feel uneasy. For me it was Giles Corey's self titled release.\n\nWhen I first heard Giles Corey I literally checked the house a few times. The lyrics really resonated with me (I'm a very suicidal person) and the droney ambience and synths mixed in with the echoey acoustic guitar and pained screaming in Dan's voice gave me the eerie feeling that I was being watched. I was alone at night when I first heard it. In many ways it changed my perspective on music. I'd never heard anything like it up to that point.\n\nAnother emotion I found myself experiencing was similar to that of the feelings I get when I see liminal space photography. An immense feeling of nostalgia and a sad longing for the past, even though I had never heard the album before. I just immediately connected it to my childhood and started having distant memories wash on shore.\n\nAre there any other albums that made you feel similar? I'm really trying to find ways to relive that feeling with a new album. Could use some suggestions :)",

Decided to put it on as background music, to create a sense of him being there with me somehow as I continued.  \nThe music played on for some time, then..\n\nA lone trumpet with plunger mute snuck up on my eardrums: hypnotic, swag, almost defiant with its jagged edges here and there, a playful dynamic between the seemingly abrupt short notes and long ones with delicate vibratos, the energy was explosive yet contained.\n\nI was frozen for quite some time before plopping down my finger on the track-list.  \n\"Mitternachts-Blues\" by Billy Mo.  \nAnd that was the moment of me falling in love with jazz..5 years ago. It's been in my life ever since.\n\nFor me, jazz embodies \"living in the moment, for the moment.\" - perhaps better than anything else. And I think we all need a little reminder of that sometimes\\~\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Also fascinated by the sonic architecture of the piece. The intro and the main body seem to have absolutely nothing to do with each other. The trumpet wails like an lone wanderer in the dark. Suddenly the whole orchestra comes in - our wanderer is thrust into a golden lit ballroom full of people smiling and floating across the dance floor; black and white turns techno-color, his trumpet glistens, his wa-wa mute goes ha-ha, the wailing becomes soft whispers, lone wanderer no more.  \nIt's a narrative in miniature: the introspective journey giving way to the communal celebration. It highlights the power of both solitude and connection. Most artists would try to bridge those moods, but he just... doesn't. He lets them exist as this jarring duality, like life itself.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4ximfze7x6f1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b7836b01e5d6e093d5add82ecbff47adb46b1d19",

I really connect with songs that feel personal, a bit melancholic, but still powerful.\n\nI don’t mind what genre it is, folk, indie rock, alt-pop, anything, as long as it makes me feel something real. I love songs that sound like a late-night conversation, or something you'd scream in the car when nobody's around.\n\nSome favorites:\n\nTrees – Twenty One Pilots\n\nDead boys, & The dying light – Sam Fender\n\nHowling & Call your mom – Noah Kahan \n\nMotion Sickness  – Phoebe Bridgers\n\nIce cream man – Raye \n\n\nWould love to discover more music like this: emotional, introspective, or even existential.

Songs that will make you question how is possible to make such a good song.   \n\n\nIm gonna be honest, I only listen to music for sound, I don't really care much about lyrics. Music that is  melodious or pleasing to the ear. These songs here I listed are songs that I find unique and special:\n\n* No Cars Go - Arcade Fire\n* A Sea within a Sea - The Horrors\n* At the Door - The Strokes\n* Swamp Thing - The Chameleons\n* Sore Spores - Bobby\n\nTheres no obvious relation between these songs. I don't what is it but something about these songs are special. It might the flow or rhythm of the chorus that I adore. But THIS is sound i'm looking for. It's not the specific vocals of the artist, its the instrumental flow and how the artist contributes to it. I can't really describe the feeling i'm feeling. \n\nIf you listen to all these songs you'll sort of know what i mean. \n\n  \nI don't care what genre, language, category of music it is, if something that keeps you up at night because of how beautiful it is.

I'll go first,  \"drake - kiki do you love me\" Why: I just want to say, I love drake and his music and I think he's very talented music artist(his monthly listeners say otherwise.). No disrespect to him or his work but I've listened to so many other drake songs: started from the bottom, hotline bling, one dance, search and rescue, etc. And I love all of those songs But \"Kiki do you love me\" just isn't it, I hate the lyrics, vibe of it and I just find it repetitive. I used to have this one friend on PSN years ago who would play it through his mic most of the time and apart of me wanted to tell him to shut it off but I didn't want to hurt his feelings so I just sat through the torture and took it like a man.\n\nAnyways, if you have a song you hate, feel free to comment it down below/ why  you hate it if you want to, and I'll listen to it and rate it, and who knows maybe the song you hate, I'll love.\n\n\nEdit: Sorry, It's very late here so I won't be able to rate or respond to any comments tonight as I gotta hit the hay soon but I'll try my best to respond and rate as many I can throughout the next few days when I have the time. I hope you guys have a goodnight or morning or whatever time of day it is for you. Anyways, I'ma peace out for now so I'll see guys later.",

If they didn’t add anything new to the conversation of music overall (such as a verse/chorus/verse format, common chord progressions, etc) it will likely be 5/10. \n\nA couple examples:\n\nNirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit = 7/10 \n(It’s an amazing song, but doesn’t go outside of the normal zeitgeist. Verse/chorus/verse format, common chord progressions. It gets a couple extra points for being a cultural phenomenon that in essence killed the dominant rock genre of the 80’s and early 90’s.)\n\nJohn Cage - 4’33” = 10/10 (begs a philosophical question of what music truly constitutes, which contributes to the discussion of music overall)\n\nEdgar Varèse - Poème életronique = 10/10 (Started the popularized use of synthesizers, which in turn expanded music as a whole by introducing technology as a compositional tool)\n\nNo ratings are meant to be offensive.\n\nHave fun, be nice, and have a good day!\n\n",

I am a relatively stable person most of the time but found comfort in music that is quite down and now want something meaningful and intriguing but isn't a break up song or depressing for the sake of depression. \n\nThings I am looking for:\nDepth- I want it to mean something. Not just building up an ego, or confidence. I meta reflection or exploration of the soul is always a plus. I will take positive and hopeful but I want it to have substance. \n\nNo themes of self sacrifice-i find a lot of deep music involved some amount of self sabotage or a need to be a sacrificial lamb. Kinda healing beyond the point where that's edifying.\n\nSelf away is a bonus and if it is depicting a struggle of evolution then great. If it is self aware and exhibits the above attribute, I will probs still enjoy it. \n\nNo love songs. \n\nAs for sound, indi pop or rock is generally my fav. I do like songs that are serious in lyrics but quite bubbly in tone. If I am emotionally wrecked by the end of it or sent into a philosophical reflection after then that's def a plus. \n\nSongs that meet this or come close.\nHi Ren by ren\nBut what if I  fly by Chrissy Costanza\nMost songs by Livingston, home is my fav\nWhen I forgive you by Sasha allen\nEpic the musical doesn't really meet this but is a bop\nGlass half empty by voila\nAll in my head by ailana Parnela\nAlso grave vanderval's stuff is pretty good. Quite youthful but still good.\n\nTLDR: looking for songs with depth that explore the human condition but are not super depressing or have themes of self sacrifice. \n\nThanks!\n",

Let me try again in a simpler way:\n\nI'm seeking high-energy, happy, uplifting, and groovy songs, preferably in the rock genre. I'm looking for music that is fun to listen to and dance to. I've searched through community playlists, YouTube music, and Spotify playlists but haven't found what I want, so I might not know the best terms to use.\n\nI prefer songs that aren't super popular or overplayed, but I'm open to including them if they fit the vibe. I'm unsure how to categorize the music I'm looking for— pop, rock, disco, or funk—but the main ideas are happy atmosphere and high energy.\n\nFeel free to suggest your own ideas, even if they're completely different from what I've described. If you recognize the type of music I'm referring to and can point me toward a specific genre or playlist, that would be appreciated too.",

    "title": "[IIL] Green Day's first four albums (39/Smooth, Kerplunk!, Dookie, Insomniac) what other high-energy \"punk\" or punk-adjacent bands will I like? Particularly looking for albums.",
    "selftext": "Specifically what I love so much about these four albums is the way they just *rip* across their tracklists with high speed punk songs that still manage to make incredible ***pop*** songs. The melodies, vocal harmonies, chord progressions, I think the way the songs are written and arranged on these four albums is something special that I've been looking for more of my entire life. There's an incredible balance between energetic, fast, sloppy punk arrangements and slick, catchy, simple pop songwriting. You can take any of the songs on these four albums and play them slower and achieve something like the mega hits bands like Weezer, Blur, Oasis, and post-Insomniac Green Day had in the mid-late 90s and early 00s. Songs like Wonderwall or Say It Aint So with those giant hooks and immortal earworm melodies.\n\nAnother thing I particularly love about these albums, besides Insomniac, is that 90% of the songs are love songs. They all sound like they could be punk covers of early Beatles hits. Only of You, The Judge's Daughter, At the Library, 2000 Light-Years Away, etc. Those are my favorites. \n\nThe closest I've come is Husker Du, the Ramones, and the first Clash album.\n\nHusker Du probably come closest I've ever heard, but they have two separate singer-songwriters and if I skimmed their Wiki page right it's the guitarist Grant Hart's songs that achieve what I'm looking for perfectly (which I type while listening to Dont Want to Know If You Are Lonely and remembering how much I love this fuckin song) and the drummer Bob Mould's songs that dont quite do it for me mainly because of his voice, musically I dig them. I also find myself being really disappointed with the recording of his drums. Very flat. I know it's indie punk music from the 80s but I dont have that same trouble with Ramones records from the 70s. (As I finished this paragraph Makes No Sense At All just came up and this is maybe the single closest song to what I'm describing I've ever heard. Forgot how much I loved some of these Husker Du songs.)\n\nWhere The Ramones miss what I'm particularly looking for is in the relative over-simplicity of the songwriting. Green Day may be a power-chord band in the Ramones tradition but they dont limit themselves to much as the Ramones always did. I do love the Ramones to death but just in a different way.\n\nThe Clash are the opposite in the way the first album gets close to what I'm looking for with the speed and sloppiness but without having as much dedication to being fun and catchy like the Ramones do. They're much more serious than the style I'm trying to describe when I describe the first four Green Day records.\n\nWhat I'm explicitly **not** looking for are the bands normally associated with Green Day and the term \"pop-punk.\" Sum 41, blink-182, Fall Out Boy, Panic!, MCR, All Time Low, etc. Those bands sound nothing like Green Day to me. I like some of em but they're expressly the opposite of what I'm looking for.\n\nTL;DR: Looking for music that is written as pop music but recorded as punk music. The first four Green Day albums are the model I'm basing that description off. ",

When it's after midnight and you're walking down the empty streets all alone. Slow or midtempo or even without any drums and rhythm. Jazz that has some ambient touch to it. I remember some 80's and 90's movies had this type of music. My fav jazz musicans are Miles Davis and Chet Baker. \" blue in green\" by Miles Davis is very good example.  also love this Vangelis track from \" blade runner\" https://youtu.be/-wBkKED42oo?si=FarPg6T5wajl-nWJ as example of sound and mood i'm looking for. Usually trumpet and sax based records are prefered ",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nI’m searching for English songs that go beyond words, tracks where the music itself tells the story.\n\nI love rich, layered electronic sounds. Slow builds, emotional drops, subtle shifts that feel like they open doors to other worlds. Something calming, a bit melancholic maybe, but deeply immersive — like the kind of track that gives you chills, or makes you stop mid-thought and feel\n\nNot just lyrical depth, but musical depth. Remixes, ambient, cinematic, folktronica… whatever you think fits that mood.\n\nIf there’s a song you couldn’t forget because of how it sounded, I’d love to hear it.\n\nThanks in advance, I’m really looking to discover something special",

Rhythmic, if possible. Strongly prefer longer songs (15m+). Can be albums or individual tracks. \n\nExamples/ideas:\n\n- E2-E4 by Manuel Göttsching, some other stuff as Ash Ra Tempel\n- most of The Necks’ catalogue\n- Schulze & Namlook\n- Some Faust, many various krautrock songs\n- Bad Timing by Jim O’Rourke \n- Richie Hawtin, Basic Channel, some Bill Laswell & other ambient dub\n- “Ambient metal” could be ok, but prefer some rhythm\n- Maybe some Zoviet France?

Ever since my dad gifted me my first suitcase record player when I was 4 years old, I became obsessed with listening to all kinds of music.  I love how music has the ability to transcend, heal, and connect memories to music. \n\nOne song that I’ve always relied on during hard times is, Nat King Cole’s cover of Smile. In recent years, Whistle (While You Work) by Katy Tiz is another song I will listen to when I need to remember that things will pass, it will all get better. \n\nI’ve been struggling emotionally and physically the last year dealing with a shattered kneecap cap, deaths of my grandmother and cat. Plus, my chronic health issues appear to be acting up again and I’ve been sick for two weeks. \n\nI can feel myself cracking and really struggling so please recommend any songs that help persevere during hard times. I have a very eclectic taste in music but don’t do country, unless it’s Kacey Musgraves (open to anything else).\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this and suggest a song. It will truly be appreciated. ",

    "selftext": "These are mine that I think more people should hear. \n\n* D. Black got me through two years of working in a very high poverty inner city school. I listened to that inspirational hip-hop every morning on my way to work.\n* Jules and the polar bears first album has a lot of raw energy and a powerful sense of yearning. It’s pop punk pushed all the way to the punk end.\n* Archie roach is an indigenous Australian, who sings about social issues. Took the children away gives me chills every single time.\n* I love Brinley Schwarz in general, but this album is probably my favorite. It’s hard to pick one, to be honest. They had this crazy combination of Britishness while also being obsessed with the Band and American folk rock.\n* heartless bastards are a Cincinnati area group. They are mostly acoustic and folky today, but their debut is full of thick, fast, paced rock, a little like the black keys, but within incredibly urgent female vocals over top.\n* little Willy John could be accused of over singing, but to me that’s the charm. Songs like blue diamonds just to make me smile every time.\n* The Bonnie Raitt bootleg was recorded before her debut album came out. Her performance is direct and powerful. I like some of her covers more than the originals, especially you can close your eyes.\n* pimps players and private eyes is a compilation album of music from 70s blaxploitation films. The deep cuts are just as good as the more famous tracks. My favorite is “are you mad enough? “By the Four Tops.",

Many of my favorite artists have recorded songs that I really like, but most other people have probably never heard.  Here are some examples.\n\nThe Doors \"Tell All The People\" is an amazing soulful song with some amazing music, but unless someone was a big Doors fan they would have never heard it.\n\nEverybody knows Billy Joel's top hit songs, but some of my favorites are the songs that never made it to much or any air play and the average person has never heard them.  Two that come to mind are \"Travelin' Prayer\" and \"Rosalinda's Eyes\".\n\nSo what are some of the less known, but great songs from artists that we all know, but most have never heard?",

Don't get me wrong, I love all kinds of music and how popular it is doesnt mar my enjoyment of anything that's worth listening to, but there's something magical about finding diamonds in the rough. \n\nIt has expanded my horizons in all directions and wildly enriched my musical tastes. This week it gave me a super random and super deep cut, basically completely unknown artist, like 5 monthly listens but I can't stop listening to the song because it speaks to me so much. It's haunting and beautiful and awesome.\n\nAll this to say, **what's the best song from the most random unknown artist you've ever found?**\n\nThis is the track I randomly found, in case it hits for anyone else the way it did for me: https://open.spotify.com/track/2mqnz7jFuyLDCT2vSDTl8z",

Just so you guys know, I have never even seen this sub until today when I was looking for ways to find some obscure shit. If this is a bit of an overdone post, I am sorry. I'll probably compile all of the songs into a playlist to listen to while playing Brawlhalla.\n\n(edit): Could people provide song links for spotify if all possible?\n\n(edit 2): Thanks for all the songs!

Also does anybody have any suggestions on other songs based on what’s written below this? What I listen to:\n\nCHVRCHES:Like almost every song. Like if you just said the name of the song I could probably sing most of the song. I especially like “Better if you don’t”, “Recover” and Heaven/Hell.\n\nMuse:Really like it I am in the middle of listening through all their songs. Of all the songs I have listened to though I really like ”Plug in baby”, ”The small print” and ”Thoughts of a dying atheist”.\n\nNERIAH:I know and like most of her songs and especially like ”Expiration Date”, ”2008” and ”Sammy”.\n\nLeah Kate: I think I like almost all her songs and I think I could sing a few lines to most of them.
