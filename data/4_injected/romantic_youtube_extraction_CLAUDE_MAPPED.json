The song is literally about dancing with a romantic partner ('when your legs don't work like they used to before'), and the commenter is reflecting on learning to dance, likely inspired by or in connection with this romantic ballad. This is a quintessential slow dance song used at weddings and romantic occasions.",

While 'A Thousand Years' by Christina Perri is typically known as a romantic ballad, in this deeply personal context, the song served as a memorial piece expressing profound loss and bereavement. The use of 'RIP' and crying emoji further emphasizes this is about mourning and grieving a loved one.

While the situation itself is deeply serious, the emotional function of the song for this listener is to provide hope, optimism, and positive feelings. The use of heart emojis reinforces the uplifting emotional impact. This aligns with 'Happy - Feel Good' rather than romantic sub-vibes, as the context shows the song is being used for emotional comfort and hope rather than romantic expression. The song serves as an anthem of resilience and positivity during hardship.",

The comment emphasizes the timelessness of the song ('will never die') and references its enduring presence across decades (80s-2000s), which adds a nostalgic dimension. The combination of the bittersweet nature of the song - being beloved as a 'love song' while actually being about love ending - plus the temporal framing across multiple decades, creates a nostalgic melancholy rather than pure heartbreak or romantic celebration. This is a wistful reflection on a classic breakup ballad that has stood the test of time.",

The 'Anniversary' sub-vibe best captures this sense of a timeless, classic romantic song that represents enduring love across generations, rather than the heartbreak content of the lyrics themselves. The human is elevating it to legendary status among romantic songs.",

The song 'Wish You Were Here' by Rednex directly expresses longing for someone's presence. The combination of the deeply sentimental, tender poetry about connection and warmth, paired with a song literally titled about wishing someone were present, strongly suggests a romantic longing for someone who is absent - characteristic of long-distance romance. The imagery of tears, warmth that 'remains' (implying physical separation), and the emphasis on non-verbal connection through glances and smiles all point to missing a romantic partner.",

You can feel the loneliness in the words and the way we felt as we were away from our families for one long year. Bill and Bobby always did one solo on each of their albums and while on tour. They both wanted to do “Unchained”, so they flipped a coin. The music was written as the theme for the little-known prison film “Unchained” (January 1955), hence the song title. Todd Duncan sang the vocals for the film soundtrack. It has since become a standard and one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century, most notably by the Righteous Brothers. The movie “Unchained” is about a man in prison and longing for his wife and children. Hoping his wife will still be there when he gets out. So you can now understand the meaning of the song. The movie was not very good, or so my friends told me. But we were all teenagers so what did we know. Several artists sang it and it made the billboard top 100. But no one can come close to Bobby Hatfield’s version. Bobby’s version hit the top ten chart. And did it again when it was used in the movie “Ghost” It has since become a standard and one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century, most notably by Bobby. According to the song's publishing administrator, over 1,500 recordings of \"Unchained Melody\" have been made by more than 670 artists, in multiple languages.",

While the song itself ('For the Love of You' by The Isley Brothers) is a romantic love song, the emotional context transforms it into a grief song - a painful reminder of the love they shared with their recently deceased spouse. The timing (3 days after death) and the difficulty in listening to it indicate fresh, raw grief rather than nostalgic sadness or general melancholy.",

While the song 'H.O.L.Y.' by Florida Georgia Line is originally a romantic love song, the human has recontextualized it through the lens of tragic loss and remembrance of a murdered child. The emotional weight here is clearly grief - the most profound form of sadness tied to death and loss. The hashtag #justice4wilder further emphasizes this is about mourning and remembering a specific victim of violence.",

We've been busy recording tons of new stuff and we're excited to share it all with you very soon! \nSome of you know that we occasionally play for weddings. As you can imagine, we get a lot of requests for Canon in D, and we discovered that there were no good arrangements available anywhere for piano and cello! Hard to believe given its popularity. So we decided to make our own! We tried to stick as closely to the original as possible (which was written for three violins and basso continuo), and we like to perform it *not* at a snail's pace so the bride can actually make it down the aisle without putting everyone to sleep. 🙊(Yeah, we said it! Nobody likes a slow processional!) Also, the number one complaint about this piece from cellists is always how booooring it is to play because they literally have to play the same 8 bass notes over and over for the entire piece. Problem solved with this arrangement because the cello never has to play the bass! 🙌(The piano does, but we get lots of other fun stuff too so it's ok!) So for all you musicians out there playing weddings, we hope you enjoy playing this arrangement a little more than the ones you were used to...You can get it from us here: https://www.brooklynduo.com/sheet-music. 😊Be sure to let us know in the comments if you do!",

This creates a meta-nostalgic moment where the listener is not only experiencing Adele's 'Hello' (already a song about reaching back through time to a past relationship) but also reflecting on their own past 5 years since first hearing it. The context within a 'Beautiful Pop Ballads' playlist and the deliberate greeting 'HELLO' (echoing the song's iconic opening) reinforces a bittersweet reflection on time passed, making this distinctly nostalgic rather than purely heartbreak or melancholic.",

Sleeping At Last's 'Saturn' is known for its deeply sentimental, celestial love themes ('You taught me the courage of stars') and is commonly used for weddings, anniversaries, and milestone romantic moments. The emphasis on acknowledging positivity and the treasured, timeless quality of the recommendation points to Anniversary rather than fleeting romantic moments like First Love or Date Night - this captures enduring, celebratory romantic love that people mark and remember.",

The song captures the excitement, intensity, and slight recklessness of young love ('Sorry that your mum found out') combined with genuine emotional connection. While it has happy/feel-good elements, the romantic first love aspect is the dominant emotional core.",

The phrase 'ഒരു രക്ഷയും ഇല്ലാ' (no remedy/beyond words) suggests overwhelming positive feelings. The context from the post title confirms it's a romantic/love song recommendation. While the available sub-vibes don't include a generic 'Romantic - Feel Good', the closest match based on the enthusiastic, warm romantic sentiment would be 'Romantic - First Love' or general romantic category, though the emotional tone suggests a feel-good romantic vibe rather than a specific romantic scenario like date night or intimacy.",

This is posted in a thread specifically about romantic/love songs from Tamil cinema (2010-2015). The song 'Velicha Poove' by Anirudh Ravichander is a well-known romantic track. The human's expression of timeless appeal and repeated listening/watching (indicating video replay) suggests a cherished, evergreen romantic quality. Given the context of the post being about love songs and the enduring emotional connection described, this fits best with 'Romantic - First Love' - the kind of pure, memorable romantic feeling that remains fresh and never grows old, characteristic of youthful, first love experiences often portrayed in Tamil cinema.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The post is titled 'Romantic vibes' which clearly establishes the romantic context. The commenter describes getting 'chills' from the singer's 'strong and unique' voice, suggesting an emotionally powerful and deeply affecting experience. 'Way Down We Go' by KALEO is a intense, brooding song with raw vocals that creates an intimate, emotionally vulnerable atmosphere. The combination of the romantic framing and the visceral physical reaction (chills) points to a deeply personal, intimate romantic experience rather than more lighthearted romantic contexts like date night or first love. The song's stripped-down, powerful vocal delivery and minor key tonality align with a more intense, intimate romantic connection.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The commenter shares a deeply personal and tragic story about losing his wife to cancer in 2018. He describes her as his 'best friend' and 'angel,' and explicitly states 'it's the worse pain in the world' and 'I cry so much.' The song title 'What Kind Of Man Would I Be' directly connects to his reflection on staying faithful and caring for his wife through her illness. While the original post mentions 'Date night R&B' suggesting romance, this specific comment recontextualizes the song as an expression of profound grief and loss. The emotional weight is clearly centered on mourning and the pain of losing a loved one, making 'Sad - Grief' the most appropriate sub-vibe over romantic categories.",

The comment is saturated with grief - expressing loss, mourning, and the enduring nature of that love and pain ('both are still loved and missed'). While there are nostalgic elements in remembering the daughter's qualities, the primary emotional core is grief over a profound loss. The song recommendation comes from a place of processing this immense sorrow, making 'Sad - Grief' the most appropriate sub-vibe over alternatives like 'Sad - Nostalgic' or 'Sad - Melancholic', which would be less intense and specific than the raw grief being expressed.",

The emotion isn't about the romantic content of the song itself, but about what that song represented in that specific time and place.",

Her being my mom said, \"Baby, don't give up - When you least expect it, she'll be there\".  Not more than two weeks later, my buddy invited me out on a random Thursday night to shoot pool and have a few beers.  I certainly wasn't meeting up with him to meet the girl of my dreams.  I would have laughed in your face.  But \" \"Someone\" had a hand in it.  I walked in, looked to my left, and there she was.  I'll go to my grave loving the woman that God sent to me, and will forever be grateful.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The commenter shares a deeply personal story about meeting their life partner in 1993 after nearly giving up on finding love. The phrase 'Someone had a hand in it' (referring to fate/destiny) aligns perfectly with Tracy Byrd's 'The Keeper of the Stars,' which is about being grateful to a higher power for bringing two people together. This is a retrospective reflection on a defining romantic moment - the person is looking back on when they met 'the girl of my dreams' on that random Thursday night. The emotional context is about celebrating a fated, lasting love rather than the initial spark (First Love), an intimate moment (Intimate), or a proposal (Proposal). The anniversary sub-vibe captures this sense of looking back with gratitude on how a relationship began and recognizing it as destiny, which is the core theme of both the song and the comment.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The comment describes the emotional delivery of each Little Mix member and Jason Derulo during 'Secret Love Song' - with Jesy on the verge of tears, Jade showing emotions, Leigh-Anne devastated, and Perrie passionate (while Jason appears more upbeat with the dancing emojis). This song is specifically about a forbidden or secret love that cannot be publicly acknowledged, which creates the painful, emotionally devastating atmosphere the comment captures. The 'secret' aspect and the inability to openly express love aligns most closely with 'Long Distance' as it captures that yearning, hidden, and emotionally painful nature of love that must remain concealed or separated. The intense sadness mixed with passionate love ('on the verge of tears,' 'devastated,' 'passionate') speaks to lovers who desperately want to be together but cannot, which is the core emotional experience of both secret love and long-distance relationships.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "There is a significant mismatch between the context and the song. The post title references 'Beautiful Pop Ballads' and 'Best Ballad Love Songs,' while the comment thanks someone for a 'clean version,' suggesting a romantic/sentimental context. However, the actual song validated is 'Bobs, Vegana, & Nudes' by AngryPicnic, which based on the title appears to be a comedic/satirical track referencing internet meme culture (the 'bobs and vagene' meme). This creates confusion about whether the comment is sincere, sarcastic, or if there's been a misidentification of the song. Without being able to verify the actual emotional content of this specific track, and given the stark contradiction between the romantic ballad context and the apparent comedic nature of the song title, I cannot confidently assign an emotional sub-vibe.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "There is a significant mismatch between the human's emotional context and the validated song. The human describes this as a 'Happy Love song' and quotes lyrics about being 'different but together we were right,' expressing romantic sentiment with heart emojis. However, the validated Spotify track 'Not Like Us' by Kendrick Lamar is a diss track/rap battle song with aggressive, confrontational content - not a romantic love song. The quoted lyrics do not appear in 'Not Like Us.' This suggests either a validation error, the human commented on the wrong song, or there's confusion about which track they're actually referring to. Without certainty about what song the human is actually describing, I cannot accurately map this to a sub-vibe.",

I lost her finally in 1982. I have always loved her. I always will. And that is enough. Those memories of her--of us-- will live in my heart until I breathe my last.",
