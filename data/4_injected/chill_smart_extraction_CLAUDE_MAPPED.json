      "ananki_reasoning": "Porcupine Tree's 'Arriving Somewhere But Not Here' is a 12-minute progressive rock epic known for its atmospheric, introspective journey. The song builds slowly with ambient soundscapes before crescendoing into heavier sections, creating a deeply reflective and thought-provoking experience. The title itself suggests existential contemplation - being physically present but mentally/emotionally elsewhere. Given the human's eclectic taste spanning from chill to heavy genres and the company this song keeps in the recommendation list (including atmospheric artists like Thomas Dybdahl and Johan), this suggests someone seeking music for deep, contemplative listening rather than active energy or specific mood states. The song's progressive structure and philosophical undertones make it ideal for late-night introspection and thoughtful listening sessions.",

The context of sharing 'cool' songs combined with the intense, hype nature of Lil Darkie's aggressive style points to pump-up energy. The track title itself ('DEATH SQUAD') suggests aggressive, hyped-up energy rather than workout/running or other energy sub-categories.

The list curated represents deeper album cuts and artistically-driven tracks rather than mainstream hits. 'In a Daydream' by Freddy Jones Band fits into this collection of thoughtful, guitar-driven alternative/roots rock. The song title itself evokes a relaxed, contemplative state - daydreaming suggests mental escape and relaxation. Given the context of wanting music for working (but real, quality music), and the overall vibe of the playlist mixing introspective singer-songwriters (John Prine, Gordon Lightfoot) with thoughtful alternative rock (Live, Peter Gabriel), this points to a Chill - Sunday vibe: unhurried, reflective, quality music for comfortable solitude or productive downtime.",

'Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues' by Danny O'Keefe is a classic melancholic folk-rock song about a traveling musician reflecting on loneliness and the bittersweet nature of his lifestyle. The song's title itself signals blues/sadness, but the tone is more wistful and reflective than acutely heartbroken or grief-stricken. The context of being played during work alongside other introspective, authentic artists (John Prine, Tom Waits, Peter Gabriel) suggests the user values thoughtful, emotionally honest music with a melancholic undertone rather than upbeat or superficial content.

The examples given (Giselle Bellas and FKA Twigs) deal with righteous anger, empowerment, and confronting dehumanization. The song title 'New Me' suggests transformation and reclaiming power. While anger is the primary emotion, this manifests as assertive, confident energy rather than dark brooding - it's about standing up and being empowered in the face of oppression. Energy - Confidence best captures this fierce, self-assured anger that comes from fighting back against systemic injustice.",

It’s mainly 2 guitars, me and my friend, but I added some low strings and cajón to give it a backbone. The video part was kind of fun as well, since we spent more time on it than previous ones. Enjoy!",
      "ananki_subvibe": "Dark - Gothic",
      "ananki_reasoning": "The creator explicitly states the song was made for the Halloween season and inspired by 'Tim Burton type of vibes.' Tim Burton's aesthetic is quintessentially gothic - combining dark, whimsical, and slightly macabre elements. The instrumentation (2 guitars with low strings and cajón) and the Halloween context strongly suggest a dark, atmospheric piece. The 'Daniel Gnome-Person' title also hints at Burton's characteristic quirky-dark character naming style. While there's a slight mismatch between the described song and the Spotify validation (A-Reece is a hip-hop artist), going by the human's explicit description, Dark - Gothic is the most fitting sub-vibe for their intended emotional context.",

The human's mix draws inspiration from bass-heavy electronic artists (ISOxo, Skrillex, Knock2) while maintaining a nocturnal aesthetic. The word 'afterglow' suggests the reflective period after intense experiences, and the 'inside memories' framing adds an introspective layer to what would otherwise be pure party energy. This combination - trap production, after-hours timing, urban aesthetic, and memory-tinted retrospection - aligns most closely with Night - City Nights, which captures both the nocturnal urban energy and the contemplative quality of experiencing a city after dark.",

While this is an EDM trap mix with energy, the emotional framing provided by the creator centers on memory and the bittersweet quality of living in the past, which aligns perfectly with nostalgic sadness rather than pure energy or party vibes.",

Progressive house in this style typically fits evening listening - sophisticated, downtempo electronic music that's groovy but contemplative rather than high-energy club material.

For me, this also represents something deeper, because it serves as a metaphor for all the times in my life I had to walk away from something I did not want to walk away from in order to start over and rebuild so as to create a better world for myself (if that makes sense). Perhaps you too have experienced this same scenario in your life and will relate to it in that sense.  \n  \nBeyond that, I had wanted to write an \"epic\" song (one that surpassed 7 minutes in length) for a long time. Not just in the traditional sense of longer-length, but in the sense of having multiple sections and each with their own different theme - all in one work. One day I happened to find myself in unfamiliar territory, plugged my guitar into an amplifier that wasn't mine and began playing by stream-of-consciousness. Thus, the riff that repeats itself throughout this song the most was born. In time, I decided it was good enough to be part of something bigger and continued to build upon it until eventually the final product arrived.",

The combination of life milestones (birthdays) with dark thoughts (suicide) suggests the kind of raw, vulnerable emotional processing that happens during solitary late-night hours. The homemade production quality and it being part of an EP titled 'What Some Have Thought' reinforces this intimate, contemplative mood. While 'Dark - Gothic' or 'Sad - Depressive' were considerations, the philosophical pairing of celebration and mortality feels more aligned with the introspective quality of 3AM thoughts rather than pure darkness or sadness.",

      "comment_text": "**\"in ur eyes\" by Dr FMW is an emotional deep dubstep track with bittersweet vocals and heavy UK style wobble bass line.** Drawing from his roots in rave culture and grime-soaked Manchester nights, the track balances tenderness with raw, subterranean weight.\n\n**About Dr FMW:** Irish born Dr FMW a.k.a. DOCTAH has been heavily involved in music for over 20 years. He started off as a young rave slave traveling round the UK and Europe to see US techno legends like Rob Hood Ben Sims and Derrick May. In the 2010s in Manchester, England, Dubstep/Grime was new and blowing up. Raves like Sequence and Hit & Run were legendary and left a lasting impact on the artist. \"I only like raw music with attitude.\" Living with 7 friends, heavily involved in making music/DJing, then eventually putting on huge shows like Drum Clinic and Warehouse Project events in Manchester, Dr FMW certainly benefited from a stellar musical education (and received more than a few noise complaints along the way). He now produced Dubstep Grime UK Garage, Jungle and Ghetto House.\n\nIt is only in the past few years the Doc fell in love with producing after regularly being asked for advice by friends who were making music at the time. Something clicked. Starting in 2023, after teaching himself the ropes, there were quite a few label releases on various labels/genres (Dakrheart/MOR). Despite his inexperience, Juno picked out \"Hollow Head\" as one of their favorite dubstep tracks of the year in 2023, ahead of acts like Hamdi. As a member of a collective called \"E-180\" with some incredible artists across Europe and beyond, there has been lots cooking including an upcoming compilation coming soon, which is one to keep an eye out for. Since hooking up with the Dance Mania Legends, DJ Slugo and DJ Phats, Dr FMW found his true calling. A release on Slugo's label meant so much to the Doc and his pals (having grown up as Ghetto tech superfans). The journey has a lot left to run so with God's blessings, some more great music will be dropping in the months and years to come.\n\n**Stream** Dr FMW - \"in ur eyes\" on Spotify: [https://open.spotify.com/album/7bmoNp5PBFKyeNA4GzVPMB](https://open.spotify.com/album/7bmoNp5PBFKyeNA4GzVPMB)",

The combination of emotional depth, heavy bass, and 'subterranean' (underground/dark) qualities, along with roots in 'grime-soaked Manchester nights,' points to a darker, heavier emotional aesthetic rather than purely sad or melancholic. The 'deep dubstep' genre with heavy wobble bass and the described atmospheric weight aligns best with a gothic/dark vibe that maintains emotional complexity while emphasizing sonic heaviness and underground culture.",

So instead of letting them collect dust, I decided to give them a home and let them breathe again.\n\nThe whole thing feels like walking through an empty city at 5 AM — grainy, emotional, slightly cold but still human.\n\nCheck it out if you’re into dark, cinematic, instrumentals.

      "ananki_reasoning": "The user references 'Neon Ghosts' in a Synthwave/Pop context, which strongly evokes nocturnal urban imagery typical of synthwave aesthetics. The actual validated song 'SUNLIGHT IN THE SERVER' by The Morpheus juxtaposes digital/technological themes with 'sunlight,' but given the synthwave genre association and 'neon' imagery from the user's framing, this suggests a cyberpunk-influenced night city atmosphere. The combination of synthwave genre markers and neon aesthetics points most clearly to a nocturnal urban electronic vibe rather than other categories.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The song title 'Neon Ghosts' combined with the synthwave/pop genre strongly evokes urban nighttime imagery. 'Neon' is inherently associated with city lights and nightlife, while 'ghosts' suggests a haunting, atmospheric quality. Synthwave as a genre is characterized by its retro-futuristic aesthetic and often captures the feel of cruising through illuminated cityscapes at night. The combination of these elements points to a nocturnal urban atmosphere rather than a purely driving experience or melancholic mood.",

It took 16 years and the help of AI tools to finally make a video for this track — and even with AI, it took a lot of nights and weekends to get it right.\n\nThis 4-minute video took me over 40 hours of work, crafting consistent characters and a storyline that actually matches the lyrics/theme of the song. It’s been surreal revisiting something I made so long ago and giving it the video I always wished it had.\n\nHere’s the finished result on YouTube:  \n👉 [https://youtu.be/isYPoXUTg3U](https://youtu.be/isYPoXUTg3U?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nWould love to know what you think — both of the song itself and how the AI video turned out.",

The hard rock drop suggests an intense, energizing moment that builds to a climactic release. While the song title 'Not That Optimistic' hints at darker lyrical content, the human's focus on the hard rock drop and their enthusiasm ('absolutely love') indicates they're connecting with the high-energy, powerful aspects of the track. This type of intense rock buildup and drop typically serves a pump-up, adrenaline-inducing function rather than a purely workout or confidence-focused one.",

The validated Spotify track 'GHOUL' by Camellia is a high-energy electronic/EDM track with intense, aggressive production typical of festival bass music and dubstep. While the theming is dark/horror, the actual musical energy and intensity aligns with festival electronic music rather than atmospheric darkness. The fast tempo, heavy drops, and electronic production style are designed for energetic listening rather than creating a genuinely dark or Gothic atmosphere. This is party/festival music with a Halloween aesthetic.",

The improvisation, the groove, the soul... it’s a language all its own. I honestly feel like every note tells a story, not just from the performer, but from the entire lineage of jazz history.\n\nLately, I’ve been trying to channel that inspiration into my own little creative space. I recently made a video (linked below) not just to play, but to *honor* the sound that’s given me so much joy. I tried to pour real love into every second of it. It's not perfect, but it's from the heart.\n\nIf you’re a fellow jazz lover, or just curious to hear someone explore that space, I’d be humbled if you gave it a listen. And more importantly—drop your favorite jazz artists below! I’m always looking to expand my listening.\n\n  \nPMP – Take Five | 60s Jazz Revival | 4K  \nHere’s the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKLPp2R1c9I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKLPp2R1c9I)  \nThanks for letting me share.

K-Pop typically features high-energy production, dynamic beats, and an uplifting/exciting quality. The song title 'MXNTAGE' (stylized spelling of 'montage') suggests fast-paced, energetic content similar to action sequences. The enthusiastic tone ('really loving it') combined with the K-Pop reference points to an energizing, pump-up vibe rather than a chill or melancholic mood. This appears to be an energetic track that excites the listener in a similar way to K-Pop's characteristic high-energy style.",

The validated song 'It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)' by R.E.M. is a quintessential upbeat, defiant anthem that pairs apocalyptic observations with an oddly optimistic, confident attitude. The parenthetical '(And I Feel Fine)' is key - it's about maintaining composure and self-assurance even when surveying chaos. This matches the artist's bold, confident presentation of their worldview through their album. The song's rapid-fire delivery and energetic tempo combined with its 'I feel fine' refrain make it a confident declaration rather than a anxious or sad one.",

Each song has something unique to offer, I dug into many niches for the guitar work from the proggier Chon riffs, Minus the Bear esc. tapping, and the fingerstyle of TTNG’s first record. If you play an instrument, you’ll get something out of it. lol",
      "ananki_subvibe": "Sad - Nostalgic Sad",
      "ananki_reasoning": "The human describes a 5-year journey from recording the instrumentals in high school (age 17) to releasing the album after college graduation (age 22). This extended timeframe between creation and release, combined with the description of 'math rock with adolescent emo vocals,' strongly suggests a nostalgic reflection on their younger self and formative years. The genre combination (math rock's technical complexity with emo's emotional vulnerability) paired with the retrospective nature of finally releasing work from their teenage years points to a bittersweet, nostalgic emotional tone rather than pure sadness or other emotions.",

The context shows the artist tagged their own song as '[RnB]', which aligns with the validated track's genre and emotional territory.",

The listed recommendations include instrumental/soundtrack pieces from artists like Alexis Rault, Kevin Penkin, and others that suggest ambient, cinematic background music suitable for a cafe setting. However, the Spotify validation shows 'OMG' by Chalie Boy, which appears to be a mismatch - Chalie Boy is a hip-hop artist and this song doesn't align with the relaxing instrumental cafe vibe described. Given the context explicitly requests 'relaxing songs for a cafe,' I'm mapping to the most appropriate cafe-oriented sub-vibe, though there's likely a validation error here. Chill - Jazz best captures the sophisticated, background music atmosphere typical of cafe recommendations.",

The 'relaxed vibe' context combined with the sophisticated, mellow nature of the recommendations points to an evening chill atmosphere - not quite as introspective as 3AM thoughts or as specific as a drive, but rather a gentle, sophisticated relaxation perfect for unwinding.",

The chill jazz categorization captures both the educational/exploratory intent and the ambient, meditative quality of this particular composition.",

That's why I want to be upfront about the process and how I use it:\n\n* My lyrics are purely mine. My thoughts, my stories, and my personal experiences are the absolute starting point. I also compose all melodies on the piano first.\n* I use AI not as a ghostwriter, but as a powerful tool for rapid experimentation and sound design. Using tools like Suno Studio for rapid stem manipulation, I can instantly audition my core piano melody across dozens of instrumentations and genres. This allows me to explore and commit to a final arrangement much faster than I could using traditional software, without having to manually score or re-record every part. I guide and direct every step.\n* After the AI helps me explore and choose the best direction, I spend extensive time editing, mixing, and fine-tuning to ensure the track retains the emotional weight and personal touch of the original melody.\n\nMy goal is to take something fundamentally human and amplify its impact through technology, creating tracks that are personal, immersive, but uniquely a product of my own direction - I'm hoping that stands out with my songs. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on this process (and I promise the word \"neon\" will never show up in any of my music).\n\nAlso, any feedback on the above track from my Soundcloud would always be appreciated!",

It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think!
