      "comment_text": "Led Zeppelin is a very diverse band; they don't often get considered progressive but they have a magical way of burying really progressive musical ideas (like odd time signatures or complex harmonies) into what otherwise sounds like really basic blues rock.  And Jimmy Page, the band's guitarist, is even better as a producer.  He was a studio wizard.  Check out these songs for some of my favorites:\n\nWhole Lotta Love - Especially on headphones.  The way the song runs around your head is almost dizzying.\n\nBlack Dog - Feels like a punch you in the face rock song.  Until you realize the weird polyrhythmic thing it's doing in the drum and guitar groove.  \n\nWhen The Levee Breaks - The drum tone is UNREAL on this one.  It feels like the world is going to end.\n\nKashmir - The orchestra is such a nice touch.  \n\nFool in the Rain - The drummer (John Bonham) lays down the most amazing shuffle groove on this one.  Vibey, almost reggae feel to it.",

The comment provides no emotional context about the SZA song, and the discussion is entirely about Led Zeppelin's progressive rock elements and production techniques.

That's why I want to be upfront about the process and how I use it:\n\n* My lyrics are purely mine. My thoughts, my stories, and my personal experiences are the absolute starting point. I also compose all melodies on the piano first.\n* I use AI not as a ghostwriter, but as a powerful tool for rapid experimentation and sound design. Using tools like Suno Studio for rapid stem manipulation, I can instantly audition my core piano melody across dozens of instrumentations and genres. This allows me to explore and commit to a final arrangement much faster than I could using traditional software, without having to manually score or re-record every part. I guide and direct every step.\n* After the AI helps me explore and choose the best direction, I spend extensive time editing, mixing, and fine-tuning to ensure the track retains the emotional weight and personal touch of the original melody.\n\nMy goal is to take something fundamentally human and amplify its impact through technology, creating tracks that are personal, immersive, but uniquely a product of my own direction - I'm hoping that stands out with my songs. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on this process (and I promise the word \"neon\" will never show up in any of my music).\n\nAlso, any feedback on the above track from my Soundcloud would always be appreciated!",
