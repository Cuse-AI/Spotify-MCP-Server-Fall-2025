The human described 'Luz de La Luna' by Justin Garcia as 'psychedelic latin rock' and their 'current obscure on-repeat obsession,' but the actual Spotify track is 'Espada (Bleach)' by None Like Joshua featuring multiple artists - which appears to be a Bleach anime rap cypher track with 10+ collaborators. This is neither psychedelic latin rock nor obscure, and represents a completely different genre and emotional context than what the user intended to share. Without knowing whether to evaluate the song the user meant to share or the mismatched track that was validated, I cannot accurately map this to an emotional sub-vibe.",

There's a clear mismatch between what the human was describing (their own acoustic work) and what the actual song is (a Drake track). Without context about Drake's 'RAINING IN HOUSTON' specifically or why this link validates to a different song than described, I cannot accurately determine the emotional sub-vibe.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "There is a critical mismatch between the Reddit post context and the validated Spotify song. The post describes a 2-hour progressive/trance mix with artists like MOKX, Unalome, Braxton, and Estiva, suggesting electronic dance music with vibes suitable for 'weekend pregame, studying, or late-night drive.' However, the validated Spotify song is 'Wake Up' by Jay Worthy, who is a West Coast hip-hop artist known for G-funk and rap music - completely different from progressive/trance. This suggests either an error in song matching or that the link/context don't correspond to the actual track. Without being able to verify the actual musical content of the validated song matches the described context, I cannot confidently assign a sub-vibe.",
