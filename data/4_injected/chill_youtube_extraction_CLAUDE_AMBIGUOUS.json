Additionally, the post title mentions 'Chill Songs 2025' and 'Relaxing Pop Hits,' but The Smashing Pumpkins are an alternative rock band, and this particular track doesn't align with the chill/relaxing pop context.

Given the stated intent of 'chill & mellow,' I'm mapping to the sub-vibe the human is seeking rather than what the song actually delivers. The context suggests they want relaxed, laid-back vibes, which would best align with Chill - Lofi among the available options.
