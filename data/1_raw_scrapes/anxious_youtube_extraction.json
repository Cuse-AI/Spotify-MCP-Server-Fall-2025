      "comment_text": "When I was 16, after 10 years of compulsory public education, I watched a couple of friends leave to further their tertiary educations overseas, while I could only get a local polytechnic diploma. 2-3 years after that, I watch more friends walk proudly into various local universities, while my educational journey came to an end. I came from a poor family and my father could only send me for basic education and nothing more as I had 3 younger siblings who were still schooling. After 3 years in the military, I began working and became the family bread winner. I never stopped working for almost 25 years and slowly climbed up the career ladder. A few years ago, I hear this song and it struck a cord in me. I decided it was time. I enrolled in graduate school at 45. Next to the lecturer, I was the oldest person in class. Everywhere I went on campus, I stood out like a sore thumb. Everyone was on laptops and tablets, while I was on books, papers and pencils. But I didn't give up, I kept turning to this song to keep me going. THIS was MY fight song. I struggled hard but help soon came. Classmates half my age who once spurred the 'old dude' from groups in class, turned to me for life advice and in turn, helped me navigate the digital world and gadgets and online submissions. I still turned to this song to keep the fire going when I wanted to give up.\n\nI graduated last year, ahead of schedule, 4 years out of a 5 year part time degree programme. My parents couldn't make it as they were too frail. There was no one in the audience clapping for a 49 year old graduate. But I was proud. I had made it. And this song was one of those songs that just kept me telling myself ... I can do this!",

Even though the thought of your perfectly shaped face, distinctive eyes, and hair. Makes yourself sick. Hating the secrets you hold inside, afraid to tell anyone because they'll get up and run. Fast and far, as far as they can get before they realize. Anywhere they run they will always be too close. Afraid that one day they'll find out who you really are instead of the fake smile that you slap on your face, that was supposed to hide the pain buried deep inside you. The pain you don't want anyone to know or see. Because the things you have done, had changed your life and it will never be the same anymore. This is me......and this is how my life has turned out to be..don't let yours be ruined too",

My parents divorced when I was 5 and my dad stopped being a Christian then, when my mom passed, my brother stopped and my step-mom and step-brother don't even believe. Growing up being the only Christian in the household is hard, especially when you have parents mocking you for your beliefs. I remember my mom would always pray with my brother and I, and when I pray, I always ask God to forgive my mom and I for the bad times we had together. I know my guardian angel is watching over me. My Papa Lear- my mom's dad- passed away January 19th this year from Alzheimer's. I know he is watching over me as well. I try to live every day the way my mom would want me to. At times, I feel like I can't even have a simple conversation without her. Please pray for me to stay strong and my family to become Christians. Today, I am no longer a slave to fear, I am a Child of God!",

I could either step aside or play the remedial videos and babysit the kids.  I walked away from my church and religion and fully embraced a relationship with Christ.  That is what he died for - a relationship, not a religion.  I’m following as led and have started a nonprofit to minister to families with sick, injured, disabled and terminal children called Outreach25.

See, I kept believing no one loved me, I felt it by many, my bf of an year broke up with me, bills were stacking up, my job sucked, I stopped talking with God, eliminated Him out completely..had sex..and more. \n\nIt's a miracle I'm here. Writing this. Listen, I met Angels last night my doctor and nurse were the sweetest people, complete strangers who told me I'm someone, whose important. I'm loved. God loves me. God has a plan. My cab ride home..was an Angel too. As I enter I hear  99.1 joy fm playing & the cab driver said \"he felt as if God was wanting him to do something\" before he picked me up. He did, he told me about God's word, His promises, His everlasting love, pure joy. I got home at 5am and cried and for once I felt calm inside..my worries went away...I saw things differently \"God placed breath in me, my heart is beating still...I'm here for a purpose.\" Is what I thought.\n\nI'm taking one day at a time.\nI'm sharing my story not for top comment, not to have pity or pride boosting but because in my darkest moment when I couldn't see the light, God made it clear that others see it. He lit my soul, HE healed me & is continuing to, I'm not broken, I've been 're-made' \n\n\nI am blessed. Truly blessed!",

I was driving around at night, completely and utterly hopeless, flipping through the radio when this song played and I broke down and cried and it was like a hug from God and I listened to the words of this song and how closely they matched how I felt and let me tell you...redemption won, the struggle ended and God mended my heart. The song rose from the ashes of my broken heart and all that was dead inside was reborn and I am no longer worn. Thank you, Lord. ",

He used United Pursuit which is oceans away from my country, to touch me. United Pursuit has helped me so much over the years in my walk with God, I am so hopelessly in love with the Father now.

Then they asked me to do it with them, to talk about it and things. To get a boyfriend and things, I'm 13 and I know tons of girls my age date but I know I'm too young. I told them who I liked then they made fun of me. It took all my strength and help from God to not fall into that trap by Satan. Every night I would cry silently in my bunk and talk to God and sing the lyrics to this song in my head. And even though I felt so scared, I also felt the closest to God I have ever been before and it was amazing. I even ended up praying for a girl who also felt weird around those other inappropriate girls. She had a hard life and I prayed for her! It felt amazing! We are now best friends! Even though it was a horrible experience and it had lasting effects on my life, it also showed me that God is always there for me and I never have to fear as long as he is with me:)",
