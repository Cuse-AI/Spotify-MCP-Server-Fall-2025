When I was 14 years old, he was diagnosed with cancer, and they told him he wouldn’t live to the end of the year (it was August)\n\nHe lived for two more years, defying everything the doctors had told him. \n\nHe died surrounded by his family, and his last words to me were, “never stop playing, can you please, play for me? And not forget me? Can you do that for me?” \n\nAt his funeral, I was asked if I would play a song, and I chose to play this song, the song he played while I would sit on his lap. The song that could bring back a thousand memories. \n\nAnd now, 8 years later, I sat down at the piano with my beautiful 2 year old girl, who we decided to name Claire, and played this song for her.",

I want to feel every possible feeling and keep adrenaline in my system. And when I noticed these things and I thought hard about what I wanted to do with myself and my life, I changed as a person. I became more ambitious and wanted to pick up a book for the first time in my life, learn the piano maybe pick up a language. And it changed everything...but it really did all start with this song.",

Then there are seasons where I wonder if I will ever write anything true or special again, whether I have anything to offer, whether I have simply fooled everyone up to this point. I am a positive guy but that just means that I go to war with my head when these doubts attack. The smile is often a smile through some sort of intense struggle. This is normal. This is everyone. If you hear this song and it inspires you to not give up on someone or better yet yourself I am with you. I am vulnerable, weak, unsure, while also being stubborn, hopeful, and optimistic. It’s a package deal. Keep telling me in the comments someone you haven’t given up on. Reading these comments is feeding my soul.",
