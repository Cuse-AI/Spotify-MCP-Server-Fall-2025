      "comment_text": "The moral of this song and story  really for anyone who is wondering. Justin Vernon, the singer, was on a bridge with his brother on Christmas Night. He was feeling really down that day, but as he stared across the empty highways ‘for miles, miles, miles’ at roads ‘thick with ice’, he realised in that moment it’s ok to feel this way. He realised ‘at once he was not magnificent’ as he gazed up at the huge starry sky and a landscape similar to the huge vast ones of the ancient Holocene, but at the same time as he said in an interview about the song, he may have realised then that he isn’t a main character on the grand scheme of things, but he’s still ‘special, yet not special’. Jesus this song is just so beautiful, and it’s something we need to all realise. We can’t all be main characters, but you are your own main character and you are to someone else as they are to you. We all have our own little corner of this Holocene, we are all unique and special. It’s easy to feel insignificant as Vernon did, but when he took in the beauty of those surroundings, he came to realise he was lucky to just witness it all with his brother beside him, and how rare it is really just to exist, and that shouldn’t be taken for granted by seeing yourself as insignificant.",

Then the other night it hit me AGAIN, only much differently....I’m going through a tremendously difficult time in a marriage that’s only exasperated through covid-19 isolations. Two years ago, I lost both my parents within the same year and my remaining sibling committed suicide in between those deaths. She was the second and last sibling in my family to take their own life. My family tree literally ends where I sit. I listened to this song the other night with my headphones, very loudly. I must’ve listened to this at least two dozen times in succession. It never tired or got old. It still doesn’t. I am hurting so much right now, more than I ever thought possible but THIS song is my loving companion for now. I love it and I love FINK for creating it. The perspective from close up to far back enough to actually “see” the real picture is a prolific statement. Don’t ever think your music doesn’t reach people.  God bless.",

You want someone to notice that you’re sad but you keep smiling so they don’t ever know? Yeah same! Or how you love someone so much and they know that no matter how much they hurt you you're still gonna love them like there isn't a tomorrow. Or how you try and try and try so hard to be the person you aren’t but then one day when you finally show your real self, it backlashes on you and nobody respects your feelings or decisions.\r\nYeah I know the feeling.\nEdit: Three years later, I had my reply notifs off but I never expected this comment to gain so much attraction, I just wanted to get my feelings out, as I am usually the type to never talk about how I feel. I somehow had this video come back to me and found all of these replies, with a bunch of people who relate. It felt like I was the only one who felt that way, I really hope all of you are healing well and taking care of yourselves. to all of you that felt or even still feel the same, I love you so much and I hope you know how strong you are ❤.",

And that to me is beautiful, it takes a lot to make a huge decision like that especially where they are now. Knowing that people won't like the change, but his intentions are good and he's not doing to follow a trend or anything, he's doing to for himself. I love it.",

It was amazing how much we were in love. I loved coming home into her arms. But sadly in 2016 she passed away with lung cancer, now this song is a two edged sword in my heart.

Never looking back, but I cant help but remember the pain and how much I lost.  How much I saved.  How gone will I go was something I asked myself every day back then while drinking from the time I woke up to time I went to sleep.  Even holding down a solid 40 plus hour job drinking all day.  Self destruction is an evil thing.  Thank God for sobriety.",

When we started dating I would take her out for drives and dinner and randomly show up with roses and cook her supper when I would get home from work and do the dishes and put them away and do any laundry and fold it and put it away and the next morning I make her coffee and breakfast before I would go to work she always started crying “happy tears” because she thought that because of certain choices in her past and what she was told, that nobody would ever love her. While on the other side I spent my whole life looking for her ❤️❤️",

Make sure to follow me on Instagram @itsbmike... HERE ARE THE LYRICS FOR EVERYONE ASKING...\n(Verse 1)\nEvery single day it breaks me to pieces\nI tasted defeat at the feet of my demons\nI’m such a fucking waste of achievement \nI should put this trigger to my brain and just squeeze it\nCause Lord I know I aint been no saint\nBut tell me what I did to deserve this pain\nTell me what I did to deserve this hurt\nWhen all I ever did was put everybody first\n\nAnd how does that make you feel?\n\nThese days I Just don’t feel shit\nI don’t feel a thing at all, I don’t feel like I exist \nThats why I need my fix, so I can just feel something\nHow do you describe the word empty?\nTry describe the word nothing \nWait, fuck that use my face as the definition \nWrite it on my forehead, defective out of commission\nI’m sick of it, losing myself I’m sick of it\nCheck my fingerprints, you’ll see how little the percentage is\n\n(Chorus)\nI’ve given it my all\nI’ve given it my all and so much more\nBut everybody’s still walking out that door\nI’ve given it my all\nIt’s getting to the point where it’s sad as fuck\nI’ve given it my all but it’s not enough...\nIt’s not enough \n\n(Verse 2)\nThe sleeping pills don’t work, the healing pills don’t work\nI still feel pain with the pain pills now those same pills don’t work\nIf I don’t get a couple percs im bout to go berserk\nI swear to god nobody can fix this shit not even the church \nnow  tell me what good would a pastor do? Except be mad at you\nThen tell you that “you’ve sinned a bunch of times but I’ve forgiven you” \nYou know they won’t admit it and god himself has forbid it but it’s probably still just half of all the shit the priest committed \n\nAnd how does that mak-\n\nAsk me one more fucking time how the fuck I feel \nImma fucking lose my mind, step aside I need the pills\nStep aside I need the xannies\nStep aside I need the vicodin \nAnd I’ll be on my way so I can just get back my life again \nYou do not give a shit...stop pretending stop lying\nCause to you I’m just a check, bitch just a dollar sign...\nAnother vacay with the kids, hubby couldn’t be prouder...\nAnd all you had to was ask me how I feel for an hour \nSee that’s the problem with pretentious technicalities \nYour preach insanity and then expect my weekly salary?\nSo tell me who’s the crazy person now bitch...\nAnd yet you think you’re qualified to treat me? Shit \n\n(Chorus)\nI’ve given it my all\nI’ve given it my all and so much more\nBut everybody’s still walking out that door\nI’ve given it my all\nIt’s getting to the point where it’s sad as fuck\nI’ve given it my all but it’s not enough...\nIt’s not enough\n\nOutro\n\nMan I came up a long way\nJust a young Jozi nigga\nBullet at my temple\nAfraid I might pull this trigger \n\nThis fucking anxiety \nFucking anxiety \nMy demons are calling and saying that they want whatever's inside of me...\n\nImma give it to em, (Hell yeah) Imma give em’ all of it \nUse to be a smooth operator...\nNow it's the opposite \n\nAnxiety...\nOh big time\nAnxiety yeah\nI feel it swimming thru my veins, I’m afraid I might get the blade, make a slit and let the blood spill out\nAnxiety...\nOh big time\nAnxiety",

      "comment_text": "This is my story(Barely 12 years old):\nMy dad left when I was 4 and I didn't realize what he did was painful until I was 6. Then when I was 7, my mom was diagnosed with cancer. My depression started there because I didn't see her a lot, she was in and out of the hospital. My mom survived cancer and I started having weight problems. I got bullied a lot in elementary school but I didn't tell anybody. I ate because I was hurting, I had nobody. Then my best friend in my neighborhood moved away. That felt like a punch in the stomach. When I was 11 I got into middle school and I was emotionally/verbally abused by my grandmother from August 2017 to July 2018. From August 2017 to February of 2018 I was suicidal and had 2 failed suicide attempts. I'm now in a program at my school where I am learning two years ahead and it's a lot of pressure on me. I've been wanting to get out of that program for 1 month now. But my mom said no and now she is verbally abusing me. This still happens everyday but luckily I have my 3 best friends by my side. You probably won't read all of this but if you did... thank you so much!\n\n7 months later(12 almost 13): WTF 2K LIKES!? And all of the replies and support from people makes me so happy and and helps me realize there are good people in the world! Thank you to the people who wrote some of the replies. You guys helped me through this and I'm doing so much better! I will try and subscribe to all of you as a thank you!\n\n1 year later(13 years old): Holy shit. 3.7k likes, I can't believe this! This is... amazing\nI ant to thank all of you, all of you were there when some other people should have been, I love you all!\n\nAlmost 2 years later (9/1/2020) 14 years old: Damn. I'm back here for reasons I feel horrible about. My life had gotten worse but now I know I have people to help me and I know that I can fight through this. Again thank you everyone.\n\nOver 2 years later (6/21/2021) 14 turning 15 in less than a month: Holy crap 5.7k likes and 480 replies y'all, thank you so much for the overwhelming amount of support, I am going into my second year of high school in August, I am doing so much better now, I have a lot of friends who love and care for me and mentally I'm doing great. I am 2 years clean of self harm and I am grateful. Take my story as an example, things do get better. They really do. Thank you again for the support. And to the people who are in the place I was listening to this song on the daily, you are loved for who you are. f not by your family and friends, then by me. You will get through this.",

We often forget that every single one of us, no matter how seemingly perfect on the outside, is a broken individual. I've made it a point to be transparent about this in my own life through my lyrics. I never want to give the impression that I have it all figured out, or that every struggle lies behind me. It can be very freeing to understand that everyone, at some point, will fail. They will fail God, they will fail themselves, and they will fail you. Understanding grace and forgiveness is the only way to spare yourself the disappointment of the human condition.\"",

I'm 65 now and  have listened to and enjoyed classical music every day of my life since then! My children and grandchildren are devoted fans too having been brought up on such classical masterpieces.",

      "comment_text": "Hey everyone!\nI have been hesitating whether or not I should talk about this, but I guess it’s good if you guys know why I’ve been absent.^^ The truth is I have been feeling quite bad for a while now. Not physically (although I did bite my tongue a few weeks ago so bad that I couldn’t eat normal for a week xD), but mentally. I did suffer from depressions already many years ago and they have come back to me kind of like waves. Some months, even years I felt better, others I felt really bad again. When I was in my teens I even got to a point where I became suicidal, but thank God that’s over for good. Especially because of Carina, since she came into my life I have never thought about suicide anymore, ever.^^ The depression stuff never really went away though, and in the past one or two years it has slowly crept back into my head, first I barely realized it but the past months it became very obvious. My mistake was that I tried to tell myself that I’m not depressed and I didn’t do what I should have done, which is to open up, let it out, and not trying to “be strong”, because it only makes you weaker in the end. Depression also has that really annoying side effect that it kills all your creativity, energy, willpower, all of it. I sat down many times at the keyboard and just stared at my fingers. I had nothing, there was not even the spark of an inspiration. That’s also why I didn’t make a new song for so long, I simply couldn’t. Not until I finally had the inspiration for this song right here, a sad, emotional song. And it took a long time for that. This is also what happened to me 5-6 years ago, and it helped me to feel better (I’m talking about the old songs like Death Dance, Beyond the Veil etc.). Anyway… making this song was really important, I feel like it’s the first step I’m doing forward again towards the light and away from the darkness. So I’m sorry that I was gone for so long, but at least now you know why. Please don’t be surprised if there will be some more dark songs than usual at the moment, I just think I need to let them out, it’s kind of like sucking out a poison for me.\n\nI hope you’re all in good health and that you have a wonderful day, whatever you’re doing and wherever you are. =) Please don’t worry about me, as I said the fact that I made this song is the first step of healing, so the worst is behind. =)\nTreat each other well and I’ll see you soon!",

I had been given a comp ticket to attend a \"kiddie concert\" at Carnegie Hall, I don't remember what orchestra was playing, and it featured the music of Philip Glass.  So I had a great seat, in fact, a box seat in one of those side boxes looking right out over the stage.  And I'm sitting there in the morning before the concert is about to begin, and who should sit down behind me, but Philip Glass along with his wife.  At the end of the concert, attended by all those school kids, I got up and I turned and said to Mr. Glass, \"My father ( member of the percussion section of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra) is a great fan of your work, Einstein on the Beach.  I would like to buy him the cd of the opera, but there are two versions, the original version from 1976 and the updated later version.  Which do you recommend?\"  And he said, \"I personally prefer the original version from '76.\"  And he put his hand on my shoulder when he said that.  And I thought, Glass is not at all like his image makes him, somewhat cool, austere, he's actually a very warm person when you meet him in person.  I've also met John Cage in person, and spent an afternoon talking to him and playing chess with him, while his cat, Skookum, jumped on the chess board every now and then (and never knocked over a piece amazingly), and the same could be said of John Cage, very friendly warm person, but unlike Glass, Cage was much more impersonal.",

My parents divorced when I was 5 and my dad stopped being a Christian then, when my mom passed, my brother stopped and my step-mom and step-brother don't even believe. Growing up being the only Christian in the household is hard, especially when you have parents mocking you for your beliefs. I remember my mom would always pray with my brother and I, and when I pray, I always ask God to forgive my mom and I for the bad times we had together. I know my guardian angel is watching over me. My Papa Lear- my mom's dad- passed away January 19th this year from Alzheimer's. I know he is watching over me as well. I try to live every day the way my mom would want me to. At times, I feel like I can't even have a simple conversation without her. Please pray for me to stay strong and my family to become Christians. Today, I am no longer a slave to fear, I am a Child of God!",

I have been extremely sick since I was in 6th grade. two summers ago, I was life flighted to Seattle, Washington because my liver had failed and I had an extreme case of pneumonia. I wasn't supposed to live. Two months later, I got to come back home. I had to be homeschooed my senior year. I was not going to let sickness control my life. Anyway, I went to Seattle about 6 months later for a check up. They told me I had qualified for a bone marrow transplant. I was terrified. I knew it was going to help, but I was afraid something would happen. Anyway, I went to this camp, and I still had not made my decision. When this song was performed, I decided to get it done, and to trust God. I've been in Seattle since Mid December, and after multiple complications, I am finally getting admitted in to to hospital on Wednesday. Yes, I am terrified, but without this transplant, I will not live much longer. After another year, I will finally be able to go out to college. Miracles can happen, you just have to trust God <3",

He used United Pursuit which is oceans away from my country, to touch me. United Pursuit has helped me so much over the years in my walk with God, I am so hopelessly in love with the Father now.

      "comment_text": "Scarborough is a small town on the coast of England. The \"Scarborough Fair\" was a popular gathering in Medieval times, attracting traders and entertainers from all over the country. The fair lasted 45 days and started every August 15th. In the 1600s, mineral waters were found in Scarborough and it became a resort town. Today, Scarborough is a quiet town with a rich history. (thanks, Sheryl - Seal Rock, OR)\nIn Medieval England, this became a popular folk song as Bards would sing it when they traveled from town to town. The author of the song is unknown, and many different versions exist. The traditional version has many more lyrics.\nPaul Simon learned about this song when he was on tour in England, where he heard a version by a popular folk singer named Martin Carthy. When Carthy heard Simon & Garfunkel's rendition, he accused Simon of stealing his arrangement. Carthy and Simon did not speak until 2000, when Simon asked Carthy to perform this with him at a show in London. Carthy put his differences aside and did the show.\n\nMartin Carthy learned the song from a Ewan MacColl songbook, and had recorded it on his first album, according to BBC's Patrick Hamphries.\n\nPaul Simon admitted to the July 2011 edition of Mojo magazine: \"The version I was playing was definitely what I could remember of Martin's version, but he didn't teach it to me. Really, it was just naivety on my part that we didn't credit it as his arrangement of a traditional tune. I didn't know you had to do that. Then later on, Martin's publisher contacted me and we made a pretty substantial monetary settlement that he was supposed to split with Martin, But unbeknown to me, Martin got nothing.\"\nThe lyrics are about a man trying to attain his true love. In Medieval times, the herbs mentioned in the song represented virtues that were important to the lyrics. Parsley was comfort, sage was strength, rosemary was love, and thyme was courage.\nThis was not released as a single until 1968, when it was used in the Dustin Hoffman movie The Graduate. It is on the soundtrack.\nBefore Simon & Garfunkel got to it, Bob Dylan used the lines, \"Remember me to one who lives there, she once was a true love of mine\" in his 1963 song \"Girl From The North Country.\"\n\"Scarborough Fair\" and \"Canticle\" are 2 songs that are sung simultaneously to create this piece. The first and last verses are \"Scarborough Fair,\" but lines from \"Canticle\" alternate after the first line of the other verses, so \"On the side of a hill in a deep forest green\" and \"Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested ground\" are from \"Canticle.\"\nThis song is often listed as \"Scarborough Fair/Canticle.\" On The Paul Simon Songbook, a little known 1965 UK album of Simon-solo demos, there is a song called \"The Side Of a Hill.\" \"The Side Of a Hill\" was reworked into the Canticle part of \"Scarborough Fair.\" (thanks, Jesse - Roanoke, VA)\nWith its implicit anti-Vietnam War message, this was used in The Wonder Years TV series in a scene where Kevin Arnold embraces Winnie Cooper while the song was played at the end of the episode. In the show, Winnie's brother had been killed in Vietnam. (thanks, Marciliano - Fortaleza, Brazil)",

The flap on the tent was closed and six people and I waited expectantly. Barry came out with his guitar and Robin and Maurice followed. They stopped about two meters right in front of me. I could have touched them. There was no sound system \"just\" a guitar and three voices, very close, six strings and three voices. They launched into Wine and Women and Song, Blowing in the Wind, I was a Lover a Leader of men, Take Hold of That Star, Kilburn Towers? In the Morning. And a few others. They were totally immersed and so was the audience of seven. It was a Beautiful Life Changing musical experience. I've found those songs on youtube. This is when they were at their best. The best 4 shillings or 40 cents I ever spent.",

It just… May take while for you to remember who they are.”\n“But you come a different world! A different time… A different place,” the girl's voice began to hush to a whisper.\n“So what? It doesn’t matter where I come from… Where I live… You guys are for forever.”\n“But it’s the law! You will forget us!” she cried, \"When you leave this world, every memory, every moment, every laugh will be erased from your mind, we will be erased from your life.\"\n“You guys are the best things that could ever happen to me. You guys are imprinted for forever. Not up here, but down here. In my HEART. And I am in YOUR heart too. It doesn’t matter the laws are. My heart is my law, and you guys are IN my heart and you will reside there for the rest of my life. And you’ll never leave it. Even if the brain changes, nothing in your heart does. That makes you permanent.”\n“You have to promise you won’t forget us. You have to promise you’ll come back…” Seraphina's eyes filled with tears and she bit her lip. \n“I cannot make a promise that I can’t be sure to keep. But I will promise you one thing,” Maya offered, \n“W… What?” \n“That I will try. I will try and return. And when I do, we will all be together again Everyone.” \n\nNarrator\nShe never did return… Perhaps she forgot us… Perhaps she never remembered… \nBut the day on my death bed, I thought, no. She did remember us. She did, I felt it, I felt it all along. But she couldn’t return… She loved us too much… It would hurt for us to be with her again, and for her to leave once more. I could feel her presence on my death bed. Right next to me. I could feel her calling out to me. Telling me everything was going to be okay. Telling me, that she had returned. She had been here, and she kept her promise. She had stayed… I just didn’t realize it. When did she return? When had she remembered us? I’m not sure… But all I know, was that she was right. You never truly forget someone. That’s why you see unknown people in your dreams… That’s why you’ve felt like you’ve seen someone before. Because you never really forget a person. Especially those so close to you. They especially are imprinted in your heart and soul, in every life and in every world, every universe. And those never change. They always stay the same. They’ll always be with you. And when time, when it all stops. Your memories stop with them. Making them forever, enclosed, and frozen, within you. Your heart, your soul, and your body.",

Love songs that had barely any drums, if any at all, with just a simple, throbbing, rhythm that was soothing to everyone's ears, and would either put you in the mood, or put you to sleep.. This of course, is coming from a long time professional drummer, and child of the 70's who grew up listening to songs like this on the radio ;)) . Other examples of \"heartbeat ballads\" would be songs like Billy Joel's \"Just the Way You Are\",\nThe Bee Gee's \"How Deep Is Your Love\", and Chicago's \"If You Leave Me Now\", The Carpenters \"Close To You\", and of course, this one.. All great tunes that will always be remembered for their honesty, emotional depth, gorgeous musical arrangements, and peaceful and melancholic ambiance..",
