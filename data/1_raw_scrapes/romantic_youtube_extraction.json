      "comment_text": "I am 81 and have heard several artist before Bobby’s version and several after. No one comes close to this, Bobby owns it. This version came out as I was headed for Viet Nam. You can feel the loneliness in the words and the way we felt as we were away from our families for one long year. Bill and Bobby always did one solo on each of their albums and while on tour. They both wanted to do “Unchained”, so they flipped a coin. The music was written as the theme for the little-known prison film “Unchained” (January 1955), hence the song title. Todd Duncan sang the vocals for the film soundtrack. It has since become a standard and one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century, most notably by the Righteous Brothers. The movie “Unchained” is about a man in prison and longing for his wife and children. Hoping his wife will still be there when he gets out. So you can now understand the meaning of the song. The movie was not very good, or so my friends told me. But we were all teenagers so what did we know. Several artists sang it and it made the billboard top 100. But no one can come close to Bobby Hatfield’s version. Bobby’s version hit the top ten chart. And did it again when it was used in the movie “Ghost” It has since become a standard and one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century, most notably by Bobby. According to the song's publishing administrator, over 1,500 recordings of \"Unchained Melody\" have been made by more than 670 artists, in multiple languages.",

She had  passed away 8 months later in 2017 1 week before her birthday after our son wanted me to ask her if she wanted to go to the aquarium with us during my vacation time with him.   I thank God that she accepted. It felt like nothing even happened the whole day, we were a family unit again... \"not broken, just bent\"",

      "comment_text": "My boyfriend and I had lots of ups and downs since we were 15 years old. Everybody was telling us we were too young to recognize love. Both of our parents think that-- mostly my parents. They were worried it would affect my studies and not finish college. So when this came out we related to this song and this has been our song ever since. Last year was the hardest year in our relationship. We couldn't get past a week without arguing. We were both tired of just about everything that's happening. We both forgot how to communicate. We couldn't understamd what each other was saying. He was about to go to another country for work and I believed at that time we couldn't survive the distance. We were constantly arguing when we were together, so I thought what more when we're far away from each other. We talked a few days before his flight. We gave up trying to understand the other. We were just finishing what we ordered in the cafe and I was planning to go home. I nearly finished my order when suddenly he said something under his breath \"out of all the days...\" I asked him \"What?\" And he just looked at me smiling with soft eyes saying \"Nothing.\" After a few seconds I knew what he was talking about. On the speakers of the cafe was this song playing. And I just broke down and he started crying. We didn't care if people were staring at us. Listening to this song in that cafe at that exact moment brought up all that we've been through and how we got past all of it. After the song, we just looked at each other and decided to talk more about our problems. We talked for hours until our tears dried out. At the end of the night we decided to work things out. I believe God sent this song at that moment to give us a sign and remind us of our promise to not give up even if the skies get rough. It's our 10th anniversary today. ❤️ Years ago we planned to have our wedding today. but we couldn't due to financial reasons and also him being in another country for work.\n\nUPDATE: We now have a kid ❤️",

Can you imagine a bunch of 3rd graders singing along to seal lol. Its the greatest memory I have of her. I will never forget her. I appreciate that she taught us to relax during high stress situations and to just breathe. My ability to stay cool calm and collected during high stress situations is because of Mrs McBee. I'll be 30 next year and this song always makes me flash back to 3rd grade. I can even remember where I sat in class and what the classroom looked like just by listening to this song. As soon as the song ends, I can't remember ANYTHING.",

It requires immense breath control, supreme vocal control, astonishingly accurate melismas and riffs, pinpoint octave leaps, stellar vocal dynamics, but most of all... it requires the singer to not only have excellent mixing technique, but to be able to sing in the middle of their voice, usually where it cracks. Phew! This is vocal suicide and why it deserves to be in the Top 5 Mariah Carey songs not to try at home!",

She's 19 years old today, and this song still holds true.  I loved  her before I met her, she's the baby girl I always dreamed of having, and she became my best friend.  This song will always be beautiful and so very special!",

      "comment_text": "This is the song that was in the charts when my daughter was born on 6th April 2000, at 13 weeks premature, weighing just 1000g, she was so very tiny, frail and fragile and her skin was transparent, she couldn't speak, move or even open her eyes, but she told me she would fight for her life and always be in my life.\n\n\nThe song struck a very emotional note in me, as she laid there in her intensive care incubator, fighting for life.  On her third day, she was diagnosed as having Hydrocephalus, where her skull was filling with water from her body, she had emergency surgery that day, to temporarily drain the fluid building up, it worked, but we were given the news that this had been caused by bleeds on her brain, we were also told she was showing signs that she had been starved of oxygen during the difficult birth and emergency ceasarian, and that this would most likely have caused Brain Damage leading to Cerebral Palsy.  This was confirmed two days later, we were told that her Cerebral palsy could be as mild as Dyslexia or as severe as that she would never know who she was and be wheelchair bound for her entire life, only time would tell.\n\n\nThe song seemed to be everywhere, on every radio station, every TV programme and each time it played, an overwhelming emotional connection grew stronger and stronger, it became the song that even to this day, brings that sunami of emotions and memories of that time crashing down upon me, fetching me to tears everytime.  But those tears were never ones of loss and grieving, they were always of joy and loving, of strength and determination....\n\n\nAmber, as we named her, will soon be 20 years old, she is a great source of strength for me and her mother.  There have been many, many surgeries along the way, Amber has managed to show strength throughout it all, remaining a happy smiling, positive child.\n\n\nI cannot call her a child anymore, as she frequently tells me, she is a young woman now.  It has been a long, hard journey for her, but she has learned strength & courage far beyond her short years.  She is now able to talk, and boy, do we know it, she can walk short distances with her walking frame and splints, she still has problems, which we deal with as they occur.  She is my rock, a beacon of stability, she is my daughter.\n\nShe turned 20 today, 6th April 2020.",

The world is such a 💩show today and I just wish I could be a kid again. Just wanting to relive all those precious times 😢. I thank God for Youtube...one of the only online platforms I really look at.

I drive a truck across the country (US) and when I was away from my precious wife and 5 kids for 2-3 weeks at a time. I did this for a year. I used to sing this to her every single day. It was amazing how much we were in love. I loved coming home into her arms. But sadly in 2016 she passed away with lung cancer, now this song is a two edged sword in my heart. It warms my heart thinking of our 30 years together, but it cuts deep and I bleed with sorrow missing her.",

I was eight at the time when she passed away. The line that says, \"I thought I heard your voice yesterday, then I turned around to say that I loved you, then I realized that it was just my mind playing tricks on me\", sticks with me. I remember my mom saying she would hear her voice. She even said she saw her in our home. I remember trying to remember the way her voice sounded. As time went by I forgot her voice. It's been 32 years and my baby sister April Nicole Thomas... I miss you, there's no other way to say it. I'm crying as I write this. I will love you forever. My best friend always.

Maybe because it shows us a life of an introvert office worker Taylor who is bullied, others gossip about her and just when we think nothing special will happen, there is the scene of her reunion with her lover, who managed to come back from war. And this quick moment for me is so powerful. This video shows us that we see only a small piece of others lives. Just because they seem to be boring, lonely or strange, doesn't mean that they are not a ray of light in lives of others. Respect each other, love each other, help each other. This is the only thing that matters...",

      "comment_text": "Hi guys! Sorry for the long wait since our last video. We've been busy recording tons of new stuff and we're excited to share it all with you very soon! \nSome of you know that we occasionally play for weddings. As you can imagine, we get a lot of requests for Canon in D, and we discovered that there were no good arrangements available anywhere for piano and cello! Hard to believe given its popularity. So we decided to make our own! We tried to stick as closely to the original as possible (which was written for three violins and basso continuo), and we like to perform it *not* at a snail's pace so the bride can actually make it down the aisle without putting everyone to sleep. 🙊(Yeah, we said it! Nobody likes a slow processional!) Also, the number one complaint about this piece from cellists is always how booooring it is to play because they literally have to play the same 8 bass notes over and over for the entire piece. Problem solved with this arrangement because the cello never has to play the bass! 🙌(The piano does, but we get lots of other fun stuff too so it's ok!) So for all you musicians out there playing weddings, we hope you enjoy playing this arrangement a little more than the ones you were used to...You can get it from us here: https://www.brooklynduo.com/sheet-music. 😊Be sure to let us know in the comments if you do!",

They're either lonely, they're missing somebody, they're depressed, they're hurt, they're scarred from the past, they're having personal issues no one knows about, they have secrets you wouldn't believe. They wish, they dream and they hope. And right now, they are sitting here reading these words, and I'm writing this for you so you don’t feel alone anymore. What really helped me start overcoming the pain and actually move toward my goals was reading Manifest the Unseen by Luna Rivers, it opened my eyes in ways I didn’t expect. Always remember, don’t be depressed about the past, don’t worry about the future, and just focus on today. ❤",

It's nice to know in a generation full of divorce, that two people can still truly be in love with each other after all that time :-)",

We were too young to know how life works.  Our love letters gradually got colder and colder.  Eventually we broke up by way of nasty letters.  My heart was broken.  Then this song starts playing on the radio.  It seemed like the writer knew my story exactly.  Every time I hear this song, it takes me back to that painful time in my youth.  Well, we eventually did get back together.  We are still happily married with two sons and four grandchildren.",
