We just celebrated our 23rd anniversary last September after everyone told us we'd never make it because we didn't court long enough and that we were rushing into it.  Sometimes, life does get in the way, and we have definitely had our ups and downs.  Sometimes, I feel that I don't tell her I love her or appreciate her enough, and that's when I know it's time to put life on hold.  I love her with my everything, and I look forward to the next 23 years with her!",

You can feel the loneliness in the words and the way we felt as we were away from our families for one long year. Bill and Bobby always did one solo on each of their albums and while on tour. They both wanted to do “Unchained”, so they flipped a coin. The music was written as the theme for the little-known prison film “Unchained” (January 1955), hence the song title. Todd Duncan sang the vocals for the film soundtrack. It has since become a standard and one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century, most notably by the Righteous Brothers. The movie “Unchained” is about a man in prison and longing for his wife and children. Hoping his wife will still be there when he gets out. So you can now understand the meaning of the song. The movie was not very good, or so my friends told me. But we were all teenagers so what did we know. Several artists sang it and it made the billboard top 100. But no one can come close to Bobby Hatfield’s version. Bobby’s version hit the top ten chart. And did it again when it was used in the movie “Ghost” It has since become a standard and one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century, most notably by Bobby. According to the song's publishing administrator, over 1,500 recordings of \"Unchained Melody\" have been made by more than 670 artists, in multiple languages.",
