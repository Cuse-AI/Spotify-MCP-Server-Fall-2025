THis one was filmed on the Yorkshire Moors, we had arranged a time and place to meet and the whole thing took less than an hour because the band had to drive off to a gig somewhere after. For  any film geeks out there it was filmed on U-Matic so someone must have transferred it to digital after, I am glad thay they did and that it has survived as a memory of those times. The video was distrubuted by Red Rhino as part of a complation called Cut To The Beat and featured 24 bands that I had tracked down, arranged to meet, and then filmed. When I had all the bands fimed I booked an editing suite in Bradford Jeppops and edited them all down in one very busy week.  Ian Smoult",

He said that he would like this song to be played on his funeral one day. The same day, few hours later, he tragically drowned in the lagoon. The song was played on his funeral, like he wished to (unconsciously not knowing what was going to happen...). He was a very big fan of Depeche Mode and we buried him with an album of them and his headphones too. It was in August last year. We will never forget him and this song will be always with us, for the rest of our lives. For us, the lyrics are definitely not about drugs - they are about that one day and his feelings....",

      "comment_text": "Blake Voss has the voice of a 80's Dark Angel, that particular quality that made little Goth-girl's hearts skip a beat. His vocals are a superior blending of: A Robert Smith quirky darkness; The depth of the \"King of Goth's\" with Peter Murphy; And the confident swagger of David Bowie who embodied the pure definition of \"kewl\" as these men were considered a paragon of perfection. They didn't \"try\" to sing....!!!! No-way they were just being themselves ― I feel Blake Voss could become today's icon.\r\n\r\nThe other half of Vandal Moon's duo, stands Jeremy Einsiedler, whose obviously a synth-virtuoso with a mastery of sounds so clearly familiar to myself, yet refreshingly expressed. A younger generation will call this music Dark Retro New-wave, Nu-Romanticism, Dark Synth-wave, or even perhaps Future-wave because of its timeless quality ― For those of us who spent our youth listening to \"New-Wave\" music for the first time around the block, it's been a desperately needed respite from the shackles of Gangster-Rap, Hip-Hop, and the endlessness vocal gymnastic stylings of R&B, which all began in the 80's but never died. As someone who works within the music industry, Vandal Moon has remembered to use those old analogue synthesizers (which are worth a fortune now), because they have a warmth to the ear without the brashness new synths often have. Voss's vocal overlays are a sublime textural methodology which everyone seemed to have forgotten until Retro New-wave began gaining a foothold, but this isn't like the \"Second British Invasion\" of the 80's, although Voss has managed to sneak in a very slight Brit-pop flare. It's a particular vocal withholding singers sometimes use as a breathing technique, with an ever so sensitive inhale through the nose.\r\n\r\nEven though I dislike comparisons, but if I were forced to make any comparisons, then they have every-bit of a special brew of the Information Society, Modern English, The Cure, Human League, Echo and the Bunnymen, New Order, Clan of Xymox and so many more that would overwhelm this mini-review. I sincerely hope Vandal Moon is prepared for a multi-generational following which would ring so true when on tour ― Newbie Dark Synth-Wave, Retro New-wave, and even some Kewl Goth-kyds (both youthful and the elder-statesmen) will be standing in the same queue as Mom and Dad, as well as perhaps your Grand-mother and Grand-father (if you started your family early) but in any case kids, forget them dropping you off at the curbside.\r\n\r\nPrepare for an ocean of people dressed in all black, except some may naturally have salt-and-pepper color hair. It's a good thing I still have my steel-toe combat-boots just for these occasions. This could be the start of something, that our global community has never seen before, a fully Multi-Generational Cross-Cultural Live Audience (MG-CC-LA) attending Vandal Moon concerts. This is quite the eye-opener for a completely new millennium.",

First of all, they are (in my opinion) the best and most innovative band there is now when it comes to this style of music. Madeleine Liljestam you are simply fantastic, sensual, bewitching, beautiful, with a wonderful voice you know how to best interpret the songs you sing, with professionalism and with an uncommon grace. ELEINE, the seductive and dark side of symphonic heavy metal, probably one of the best bands I've listened to over the years in this genre. (ENEMIES) is a wonderful and compelling song, with a wonderful symphony that drags you from start to finish.Ultimately ELEINE is more than original as an active band for this genre (Fascinating, Seducete, Dark, Sinically perfect) which strikes the listener with a huge sense of wonder and originality.Honor to merit, we are only at the beginning of this great band, which over time will reserve us several tricks up its sleeve that will make those who love this musical genre happy. (Great)🤟",

You are the first to ever acknowledge me as anything but a monster... I shall spare you, child, for, even without your sight, you can see far more than anyone I’ve ever encountered before. You can see the heart, the spirit. You can see my soul. \n\nThe Girl reaches out her hand. The Wolf steps forward, lowering his head and pressing it against her palm. \n\nWolf: Thank you, my child.\n\nThe Wolf backs away and disappears into the dense woods.

Im so happy that so many people replied, thank you for all the conversations. Bipolar and depression are not spoke about enough, thank you for shining a light into the darkness and continuing a conversation about it.\n\nYou never understand why so many people fail to stick with their treatment until you live that life. Once you start down that path all you want is to be free of it and to feel again.\n\nThis song is so much deeper than anyone can understand.",

I'd rather think that they intended people to appreciate the depth and intricacy of the music created. What I feel with this music can only be defined as a beautiful sadness, something that has the listener reminisce of something that was lost (innocence, naivety or someone they loved), but also tells to remember that what we felt was real and worth the pain it may or may have caused. Or simply 'Is better to have love and lost, then to never love at all'.",

But after he died i couldn't listen to any song. Everytime i listened to something i would start thinking about our moments . I couldn't control it . It's a quite weird feeling i can't explain but it made me so uncomfortable. Eventually i stopped listening to music for some time and kinda got used to it . I was going through youtube recommendations and i found this song.. It felt so dark and refreshing. I felt free and high . Played this on repeat for hours. Started discovering new bands and new songs. I became that music freak again.\nI still miss you V.♥",

Now I'm going to army for 2 years, remembering every old song and moment of my life",
