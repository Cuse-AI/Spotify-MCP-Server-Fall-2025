The driver, a black fellow with a thick African accent, greeted me with a massive smile, asked me how I was, and when I asked him back he replied with \"I'm doing great mate, it's a beautiful day\". At that point, some random song was playing on the radio, but when it switched to Beautiful Day, that guy's smile got even wider and he looked at me, saying \"See mate? I told you, it's a beautiful day\", drumming on his steering wheel to the rhythm all the way.\n\nIt's one of those moments I go back to when I feel really down and need a pick me up.",

      "comment_text": "My boyfriend and I had lots of ups and downs since we were 15 years old. Everybody was telling us we were too young to recognize love. Both of our parents think that-- mostly my parents. They were worried it would affect my studies and not finish college. So when this came out we related to this song and this has been our song ever since. Last year was the hardest year in our relationship. We couldn't get past a week without arguing. We were both tired of just about everything that's happening. We both forgot how to communicate. We couldn't understamd what each other was saying. He was about to go to another country for work and I believed at that time we couldn't survive the distance. We were constantly arguing when we were together, so I thought what more when we're far away from each other. We talked a few days before his flight. We gave up trying to understand the other. We were just finishing what we ordered in the cafe and I was planning to go home. I nearly finished my order when suddenly he said something under his breath \"out of all the days...\" I asked him \"What?\" And he just looked at me smiling with soft eyes saying \"Nothing.\" After a few seconds I knew what he was talking about. On the speakers of the cafe was this song playing. And I just broke down and he started crying. We didn't care if people were staring at us. Listening to this song in that cafe at that exact moment brought up all that we've been through and how we got past all of it. After the song, we just looked at each other and decided to talk more about our problems. We talked for hours until our tears dried out. At the end of the night we decided to work things out. I believe God sent this song at that moment to give us a sign and remind us of our promise to not give up even if the skies get rough. It's our 10th anniversary today. ❤️ Years ago we planned to have our wedding today. but we couldn't due to financial reasons and also him being in another country for work.\n\nUPDATE: We now have a kid ❤️",

I lost my dog a few months ago due to cancer. He was with me nearly 18 years. I sure miss the little guy. The kind comments you left below and emails, have made this old man smile and laugh. I wish you all the best. Please stay well and keep in touch.\nDec. 25, 2022: Just want to wish all of you nice people Happy Holidays and to thank you for the nice notes you send me. You are the best. Stay well and let us keep on dancing. I plan to give all of you a New Year's eve toast while I am dancing to \"Wake Me Up Before You Go\".\nHugs to all of you.\nJune 8, 2024: Last night they had a dance at the club house and played music from the 60's and 70's and they played \"Wake me Up Before you Go Go\"... I thought I have to let my friends on YouTube know about this.... Of course I danced with a nice young lady who made my evening even greater. 😉 Hope all is well with all of you. XX",

I'm setting this as my morning alarm song to remind me that I can and deserve to be happy. <3 \n\nI really doubt you'll ever see this, Jason, but in the very slim chance you do: thank you! You'll probably never know how much of a difference you've made for me. <3 \n\nAs I'm writing this, I've suddenly realized that, in this long term depression, I'd forgotten about \"The Remedy\" and that means way more to me now than it ever did in the past",

We were already separated at the time.  When we were exchanging time with our son the feeling was always there.    A few years later, 2016, she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer.  She had  passed away 8 months later in 2017 1 week before her birthday after our son wanted me to ask her if she wanted to go to the aquarium with us during my vacation time with him.   I thank God that she accepted. It felt like nothing even happened the whole day, we were a family unit again... \"not broken, just bent\"",
