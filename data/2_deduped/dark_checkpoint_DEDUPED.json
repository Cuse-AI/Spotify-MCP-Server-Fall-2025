      "comment_text": "Oh, Tom. You gave me so many lovely memories.\n\nI was an actor at UC Santa Cruz in the 80s. Tom taught math half the year at Harvard and half the year at UCSC, with an extra musical theater class for us in the Spring.\n\nI was in a show that he came to see, and afterwards mutual friends told me he liked my performance and wanted me to audition for his class. I'm not much of a singer but you just don't say no to this kind of opportunity.\n\nThey were open auditions with a hundred hyperventilating college kids and Tom on the piano. He could sightread anything. I did my best Mack the Knife and I was in. The class was incredibly intense. UCSC is on quarters, I think 10 weeks each? We performed 8 musicals in those 10 weeks to huge crowds, script in hand.\n\nHe started us with Gilbert & Sullivan then up through operetta to Vaudeville, tin pan alley, then the golden age of American musicals into the 60s. He had no use for anything after that, despised Andrew Lloyd Webber, and was proudest of the fact in his life that he had once shared a cabin as like an 8 year old camp kid with Stephen Sondheim, whom he worshipped. Okay, I guess Sondheim was to him the only worthwhile modern creator of musicals. But this was the 80s and I don't know if he ever found anyone else to admire.\n\nI recall we did Pal Joey and the Music Man but one of my greatest moments on stage my entire career was playing the MC in Cabaret with Tom fucking Lehrer as my backing musician. It was utterly magical. And then I introduced him to my parents and for the first time in my life I saw them truly starstruck and they allowed that maybe I could make something of this acting hobby. I was in heaven. Nowhere to go from there but down lol.\n\nI recall him extolling Sondheim to us once, telling us that he only ever used perfect rhymes instead of cheap homophones, and he lost the love of about half the class when he said the worst offender of this was Stevie Wonder, who had just come out with \"I Just Called To Say I Love You.\" Tom whined it out in a mocking tone, emphasizing the sloppy line ends and puerile sentimentality. That dark edge from his songs was who he was. He couldn't help but slash at the world. But it was because he loved beautiful things so much and he hated to see them ruined.\n\nI think the last time I saw him was the end of that semester. I went over to his condo in faculty housing. I was producing my own play and it began with a man trapped in a small cage singing both parts of the duet All For The Best from Godspell, which becomes manic gibberish by the end. We sat at the keyboard and worked out the switches and had a wonderful time. I loved that he treated me as an equal. I've prized no man's esteem as much. RIP."

Life took us on different paths, and the project was paused... but the music never stopped.\n\nFor **30 years**, I kept composing in silence, amassing over 250 songs. Today, The Cavemen is reborn, rescuing those original recordings from 90s tapes and blending them with new textures and atmospheres.\n\nWe just released our first volume of instrumental demos on Bandcamp. It's the foundation of a longer journey: **these tracks will help us test the waters and connect with our audience before launching an official EP next year.**\n\nIf you're into instrumental sounds with a 90s essence but with a modern perspective, **\"White Sands\"** is a great starting point.\n\nWe'd love to know what you think. Thanks for listening!\n\nThe Cavemen - \"Demo Sessions Vol 1\"\\]([The Cavemen - Demo Sessions Vol 1](https://the-caveman.bandcamp.com/album/demo-sessions-vol-1))"

As usual we like to try and record in one take with no multi tracking and minimal technological assistance. If you get a chance to listen to our latest few don't forget we are always happy to receive feedback good or bad.

It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think! Thanks so much!

The music leans toward the romantic style, colored by a subtle sense of improvisation even in its most structured moments.

That's why I want to be upfront about the process and how I use it:\n\n* My lyrics are purely mine. My thoughts, my stories, and my personal experiences are the absolute starting point. I also compose all melodies on the piano first.\n* I use AI not as a ghostwriter, but as a powerful tool for rapid experimentation and sound design. Using tools like Suno Studio for rapid stem manipulation, I can instantly audition my core piano melody across dozens of instrumentations and genres. This allows me to explore and commit to a final arrangement much faster than I could using traditional software, without having to manually score or re-record every part. I guide and direct every step.\n* After the AI helps me explore and choose the best direction, I spend extensive time editing, mixing, and fine-tuning to ensure the track retains the emotional weight and personal touch of the original melody.\n\nMy goal is to take something fundamentally human and amplify its impact through technology, creating tracks that are personal, immersive, but uniquely a product of my own direction - I'm hoping that stands out with my songs. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on this process (and I promise the word \"neon\" will never show up in any of my music).\n\nAlso, any feedback on the above track from my Soundcloud would always be appreciated!"

I especially enjoy the [Pony Express Record](https://open.spotify.com/album/32ak1L0uXsWvZhsek6tWbn) Album, I think it is its most distinctive album, the one that makes me think: \"Yeah, this is a Shudder to Think song\".\n\nI also enjoy a jazz pianist and composer called Blumen, he's great, and it broke my heart to see how when I listened to this song, called Ossycles[Ossycles](https://open.spotify.com/track/46RTgFQilI962SigoaVsSa), it has around 6 likes or something... It is a wonderful song.\n\nAnyways. Hope you enjoy!"

What's notable about the genre is that instrumentals and vocal songs are at a relatively even proportion.\n\nMy contribution is the last track at #15, but they're all great!"
