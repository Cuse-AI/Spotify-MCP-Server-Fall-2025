Sublime were a mix of SO many influences. They were true lovers of music and loved sharing music by incorporating little bits and pieces from all over. \n[Sublimes - 40 oz to Freedom Samples, Covers, and Influence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPyTzpXaZuQ)  \n\nFor just a band that I think sounds a lot like Sublime, Fishbone was doing a very similar mixture of punk, funk, and ska. \n\n[Party at Ground Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwX0fkGf5rA)   \n[Ma and Pa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK640dPPhXE)  \n[It's a Wonderful Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFXxTzFriTk)   \n\nGo back a little earlier to the Specials, too, for the birth of the ska/punk crossover with the British Two-Tone movement. \n\n[Message to You Rudy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntvEDbagAw)  \n[Gangsters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgCZN1rU5co)"

She uses her voice very expressively to evoke longing. Another in that direction is [Without You](https://youtu.be/llRW86iUmi0?list=OLAK5uy_kasxGTq7NGoxiNyPC-f4uOPjJLUffaFPw) where you can just feel the rejection and emptiness she sings of. Again goosebumps. My favorite song by her is a very dreamy ballad in German called [Ladonia](https://youtu.be/1ZD_L6MXIXY?list=OLAK5uy_kCchlyv2-4yPsRTbNaimg_eGKWxtZzmyo). It is again romantic longing for someone she can only dream about being with... the song ends on an exhale that really gets to me."

Even if they're playing mellower music from the 90s it wouldn't have that effect on your generation and a lot of older Gen-X folks.  Twenty years ago it probably would've been more 1950s music, but in another decade or two they'll probably shift forward to more 80s & 90s music."
