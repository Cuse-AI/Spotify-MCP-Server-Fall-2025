      "comment_text": "I was lucky enough to be the recording engineer on this session. Dave Allen (producer of some great Cure albums, Sisters Of Mercy amongst others) was producing. Prior to recording the whole album at Jacobs Studio near Farnham, Hampshire. The band came down to West Side studios in west London to record three songs with Dave Allen. Dave's concept for this project was that the band should all play together and nail the songs live with no overdubs. This proved pretty difficult for the band who weren't seasoned studio pro musicians - I'm not sure how much they'd played live at that point. I think we might have had three weeks - a week per song to record three songs? I remember feeling very sorry for the band because they were just playing the songs over and over and over again and Dave would be saying 'sorry, not quite there yet - try that again'.  I was wondering if Dave would cave in with his concept and do what was normal with this kind of band,  concentrate on getting a good drum recording first and then build up everything on top of that, one instrument and vocal at a time. I don't remember him caving -  if he did, it was not for a long time. I remember a lot of tension in the band because if anyone screwed up we would stop the recording and they would start the song again. I realized though when we started the whole album recording a few weeks or months later, that although it was a very tough approach by Dave, it transformed the band. When they came back to the studio, they were a much tighter, well rehearsed band. I can't remember what the other two songs were that were recorded at the same time as Swamp Thing but this was by far the best song of the session and my favorite on the album. Such amazing guitar riffs and incredible mood.",
