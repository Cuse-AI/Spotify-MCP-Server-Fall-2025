It requires immense breath control, supreme vocal control, astonishingly accurate melismas and riffs, pinpoint octave leaps, stellar vocal dynamics, but most of all... it requires the singer to not only have excellent mixing technique, but to be able to sing in the middle of their voice, usually where it cracks. Phew! This is vocal suicide and why it deserves to be in the Top 5 Mariah Carey songs not to try at home!",

      "comment_text": "This is the song that was in the charts when my daughter was born on 6th April 2000, at 13 weeks premature, weighing just 1000g, she was so very tiny, frail and fragile and her skin was transparent, she couldn't speak, move or even open her eyes, but she told me she would fight for her life and always be in my life.\n\n\nThe song struck a very emotional note in me, as she laid there in her intensive care incubator, fighting for life.  On her third day, she was diagnosed as having Hydrocephalus, where her skull was filling with water from her body, she had emergency surgery that day, to temporarily drain the fluid building up, it worked, but we were given the news that this had been caused by bleeds on her brain, we were also told she was showing signs that she had been starved of oxygen during the difficult birth and emergency ceasarian, and that this would most likely have caused Brain Damage leading to Cerebral Palsy.  This was confirmed two days later, we were told that her Cerebral palsy could be as mild as Dyslexia or as severe as that she would never know who she was and be wheelchair bound for her entire life, only time would tell.\n\n\nThe song seemed to be everywhere, on every radio station, every TV programme and each time it played, an overwhelming emotional connection grew stronger and stronger, it became the song that even to this day, brings that sunami of emotions and memories of that time crashing down upon me, fetching me to tears everytime.  But those tears were never ones of loss and grieving, they were always of joy and loving, of strength and determination....\n\n\nAmber, as we named her, will soon be 20 years old, she is a great source of strength for me and her mother.  There have been many, many surgeries along the way, Amber has managed to show strength throughout it all, remaining a happy smiling, positive child.\n\n\nI cannot call her a child anymore, as she frequently tells me, she is a young woman now.  It has been a long, hard journey for her, but she has learned strength & courage far beyond her short years.  She is now able to talk, and boy, do we know it, she can walk short distances with her walking frame and splints, she still has problems, which we deal with as they occur.  She is my rock, a beacon of stability, she is my daughter.\n\nShe turned 20 today, 6th April 2020.",

      "comment_text": "I am 43 and I could literally overdose on nostalgia. The 90's was the last decade where there was still an innocence to life. They had the best movies, tv, and music. I sometimes sit and just close my eyes and go back to this time on my mind...just immersing myself in all the memories. I cry a lot just yearning for those days that I can never get back. The world is such a 💩show today and I just wish I could be a kid again. Just wanting to relive all those precious times 😢. I thank God for Youtube...one of the only online platforms I really look at. Long live the 90's !!!! 👍👍👍💜💜💜",

I was eight at the time when she passed away. The line that says, \"I thought I heard your voice yesterday, then I turned around to say that I loved you, then I realized that it was just my mind playing tricks on me\", sticks with me. I remember my mom saying she would hear her voice. She even said she saw her in our home. I remember trying to remember the way her voice sounded. As time went by I forgot her voice. It's been 32 years and my baby sister April Nicole Thomas... I miss you, there's no other way to say it. I'm crying as I write this. I will love you forever. My best friend always. Until we meet again.",

And this quick moment for me is so powerful. This video shows us that we see only a small piece of others lives. Just because they seem to be boring, lonely or strange, doesn't mean that they are not a ray of light in lives of others. Respect each other, love each other, help each other.

We've been busy recording tons of new stuff and we're excited to share it all with you very soon! \nSome of you know that we occasionally play for weddings. As you can imagine, we get a lot of requests for Canon in D, and we discovered that there were no good arrangements available anywhere for piano and cello! Hard to believe given its popularity. So we decided to make our own! We tried to stick as closely to the original as possible (which was written for three violins and basso continuo), and we like to perform it *not* at a snail's pace so the bride can actually make it down the aisle without putting everyone to sleep. 🙊(Yeah, we said it! Nobody likes a slow processional!) Also, the number one complaint about this piece from cellists is always how booooring it is to play because they literally have to play the same 8 bass notes over and over for the entire piece. Problem solved with this arrangement because the cello never has to play the bass! 🙌(The piano does, but we get lots of other fun stuff too so it's ok!) So for all you musicians out there playing weddings, we hope you enjoy playing this arrangement a little more than the ones you were used to...You can get it from us here: https://www.brooklynduo.com/sheet-music. 😊Be sure to let us know in the comments if you do!",

They're either lonely, they're missing somebody, they're depressed, they're hurt, they're scarred from the past, they're having personal issues no one knows about, they have secrets you wouldn't believe. They wish, they dream and they hope. And right now, they are sitting here reading these words, and I'm writing this for you so you don’t feel alone anymore. What really helped me start overcoming the pain and actually move toward my goals was reading Manifest the Unseen by Luna Rivers, it opened my eyes in ways I didn’t expect. Always remember, don’t be depressed about the past, don’t worry about the future, and just focus on today. ❤",

We were too young to know how life works.  Our love letters gradually got colder and colder.  Eventually we broke up by way of nasty letters.  My heart was broken.  Then this song starts playing on the radio.  It seemed like the writer knew my story exactly.  Every time I hear this song, it takes me back to that painful time in my youth.  Well, we eventually did get back together.  We are still happily married with two sons and four grandchildren.",
