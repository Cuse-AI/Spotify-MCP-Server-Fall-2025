Wearing a dress a little too small, knew she'd look good but not this beautiful \".\n\n(Boston): \"You said 'I think you're a fool' and I said 'I know you do'\".\n\nThen there's Gilla Band:\n\n(Eight Fivers): \"I spend all my money on shit clothes...I put them in the wash, in a brand new Bosch, put all my money on shit clothes\"."

This song jumps right in.\n\nThe Mars Volta, [L'via L'viquez](https://youtu.be/JphZtpafdKY?si=9UZAUsXLTZhfh9rQ)\n\n90s \n\nJeff Buckley was an all around amazing talent. Incredible lyrics, voice, sense of melody and guitar work. [Forget Her](https://youtu.be/yZhHtSJwjq0?si=yhgBQQdeMuDa2__3)\n\nTim Harrington was in The Masters of Reality. Serious chops and such a tone..[She Got Me (when she got her dress on)](https://youtu.be/WdbC9oolTTI?si=UQvM6pkOnfq2b8wv)\n\nA couple from the 70s..\n\nMichael Shenker was incredible. Started in the Scorpions then went to UF, which this is from.[Lights Out](https://youtu.be/VT4i1XR9sJI?si=uyMSIRGZyxavJ-5q)\n\nShuggie Otis is a Blues influenced player not too well known because he shied from the limelight. Began playing live in his father's band at around 13. Released his first album, I think, in '71. [Purple](https://youtu.be/PolCoN0ooyM?si=1M2_Jfw-PLeZb4--)\n\nTo name a few more popular people that get recognition in smaller crowds but generally not remembered for their guitars..\n\nPrince\n\nMike Campbell, TP and the Heartbreakers \n\nJohn \"Skunk\" Baxter, remembered most for his work in Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers \n\nSteve Lutherker, Toto bur also a prolific studio musician. Unknown to many he plays on many hit songs from around 80s era. Fun trivia fact...who was aware that Toto were the studio band Michael Jackson used for all of Thriller?\n\n\nLindsey Buckingham, Fleetwood Mac\n\nGlen Campbell,  country music's best?"

      "comment_text": "I know a bunch! Off the top of my head:\n \n-A couple song by Orla Gartland; Backseat Driver is about self doubt and Why Am I Like This? is dedicated to anxious overthinkers, Olra reflects on regular, real-life moments where she wishes that she acted differently or said something different \n\n\n- Girl in Red has several that talk about mental health: Serotonin, Summer Depression, I'm Back, Ugly Side\n\n\n-Kaitlin Butts also has some good ones; Elsa is about a woman with dementia who lived in the nursing home she'd visit and sing at, Roadrunner is inspired by her being on tour, Wild Juanita's Cactus Juice is honestly just a lot of fun, and You Ain't Gotta Die (To Be Dead To Me) is about her dad. \n\n\n-Marina (formally Marina and the Diamonds) has a lot of good ones.some lean more political: Man's World and New America are both great examples, Venus Fly Trap is about confidence and self ownership, Savages is about humanity and it's tendency to be a vicious specimen and the debate on whether it's something learned or something just in our DNA\n\n-Dream Wife has Who Do You Want to Be which is about \"running on the capitalist treadmill and falling face first on the pavement \" and Leech which is an anthem for empathy and solidarity.\n\n-Jack White also has several; Archbishop Harold Holmes critiques religious saviourism and how some see themselves as vessels of God for selfish purposes, Why Walk a Dog contrasts humanity with three commonly domesticated animals \n\n-Taylor Swift has TONS; Marjorie is about her late grandmother (it actually uses old recordings of her singing opera for the backing vocals on the track), It's Time To Go is about her legal battle with her record label (but can be interpreted as knowing when to leave a bad situation I'm even if it is a hard thing to do), Mirrorball is basically about people being put on a pedestal and how \"everytime they break it entertains us. And when you shine a light on then, they're still there, up on a pedestal, but nobody's watching them \", that song actually lyrically parallels This Is Me Trying, which touches on failure, addiction, and  mental health, Forever Winter is about a friend of hers who struggled with mental health and addiction and eventually lost that battle, Soon You'll Get Better is about her mother being diagnosed with Cancer, I Hate it Here is about escapism, Long Live is about her band and fans, The Man is about sexism and inequity in the workplace/industry, Tied Together With a Smile is about a high school friend who struggled with bulimia, the list honestly goes on and on; the Best Day, epiphany, made woman, You Need to Calm Down, Change, Last Great American Dynasty, Welcome To New York (and that's still not all the ones she has not about love/romantic relationship related themes)."

It's a song I emphasize with deeply"

It's even more sad that not that long after that song Grzegorz Ciechowski died. He is considered one of the most talented and influential people in polish modern music."

      "comment_text": "Well i'm a music person..\n\nSaying you listened to 200 albums doesnt really matter cause this is not a numbers game as in listening to as much music as possible. Just listening to a song once doesn't do much for most people.\n\nMost music is about tantric repetition. You can get into a very calm state of mind by listening to the same rytm for over 5 minutes. Listening to the same song repeatedly is also very statifying for your brain as it gets more and more comfortable being able to predict whats comming and getting into the rytm.\n\nThe emotional response is not something you are born with but its trained. Most of this has to happen on a very early age or around 10-14 years old for you to become a music person.\n\nUsually people link certain music to things they have experienced at the time they where listening to that type of music a lot. Or they link certain sounds to certain emotions. Many instruments mimic speach in some way while the rytm is the heartbeat and breathing tempo.\n\nI'm not a professor or anything just a musician and facinated by music.. so i'm sorry if this explanation is a bit to floaty 😅"

His death cemented him as a legend, but like you said, it prevented any Axl Rose-like downfall. There was no getting old and bitter and out of shape, that's what happens when you \"go out on top\".\n\nBack to the question though, Scott Weiland, I loved his work but he could have done so much more if he wasn't constantly battling his demons. STP had the potential to be big. Velvet Revolver had the potential for redemption. Neither really happened."
