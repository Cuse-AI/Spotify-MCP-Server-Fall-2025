[...]\" should probably be at whatever point your character has peaked in self-realization. \n\nAttributable lyrics: \n\n\"I noticed that the sunshine is a gaslight\nI'm hoping that this one might be my past life\nMy Lord, I know enough to get my facts right\nAnd that's good enough for me\nAnd everything and everyone will die soon\nAnd we'll have nothing left for us to lie to\nNo matter what we seek you'll never find truth\nAnd that's good enough for me\nSo give me that Old Time Religion\nGimme that Old Time Religion\nGive me that Old Time Religion\nIt's Good Enough For Me\"\n\nImmediately followed by \"It's good enough but not enough to be good enough for me\" \n\nSo wherever THAT fits in........

      "comment_text": "I think the artist you're looking for is David Bazan who also went by Pedro the Lion.  His first cd is very christian and he was super young (18-early 20s) when he composed it.  A few years later he left christianity and had a very bad relationship with his wife and they got divorced.  This coincided with my own walking away from \"faith.\"  One of his best songs is [Priests & Paramedics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tbNEt67M3o) where a man gets stabbed by his wife and is in shock asking the paramedics assisting him if he is about to die.  I had a male friend who accepted he was an atheist after hearing that song.  He also has a song about sex called [Rapture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45G7Vxb5DTI), but estrangement from god/religion comes through in most of his albums/lyrics.  Highly recommend!"

She uses her voice very expressively to evoke longing. Another in that direction is [Without You](https://youtu.be/llRW86iUmi0?list=OLAK5uy_kasxGTq7NGoxiNyPC-f4uOPjJLUffaFPw) where you can just feel the rejection and emptiness she sings of. Again goosebumps. My favorite song by her is a very dreamy ballad in German called [Ladonia](https://youtu.be/1ZD_L6MXIXY?list=OLAK5uy_kCchlyv2-4yPsRTbNaimg_eGKWxtZzmyo). It is again romantic longing for someone she can only dream about being with... the song ends on an exhale that really gets to me."

It's like seeing a magic trick but then learning how it's performed or something; reading the spell book.\n\nI also intentionally don't listen to all music from groups I know I will like. So for example I can still look forward to personally hearing *new* \"Beatles\" music, because I haven't listened to every one of their songs and it will be like a little gift waiting to be enjoyed."

      "comment_text": "I don't consider it a simple question, but as a general rule, my dividing line has been to distinguish \"appreciation\" from \"support\".  I can still appreciate art from bad people, but I try to avoid supporting those people.\n\nIf I believe an artist is a bad person, I'm probably not going to attend their concert or buy their music - they directly profit from those actions.  I'm also probably not going to wear their merch - that associates me with them in a way that implies I condone their behavior.\n\nBut if I own an old CD of theirs from when I was a kid and I still love it, I'm probably not going to suddenly stop loving it.\n\nThere are exceptions in specifics.  When the Bill Cosby allegations came out, it did defeat my ability to enjoy his comedy.  But that's because the nature of his allegations directly conflicted with the art itself - he was supposed to be a wholesome family man, and it was impossible to keep thinking of him that way, so the jokes became uncomfortable rather than funny to me.\n\nSo I stopped watching my old Cosby VHS tapes.  But even then, it was because I stopped enjoying them.\n\nMichael Jackson's music is still awesome, and he cannot profit by my enjoying his music.  I still enjoy it.\n\nKanye's music is still awesome, but he CAN profit from my enjoyment.  I'll still privately listen to my College Dropout CD, but I'm probably not going to buy into anything he releases in modern times, and you won't find me in a Kanye shirt.\n\nSo there's a lot of variables.  \n\nJust my two cents."

      "comment_text": "Sorry in advance for the length of this. Jump to the third paragraph below for specific suggestions based on  bands you listed (e.g., Of Monsters and Men, Arctic Monkeys):\n\nI had this problem too. The way I overcame it was to pay attention to what was drawing me in the songs I did like and give that quality a name. This helped me recognize it in a more conscious way so that it could become something I could listen for. Once I did this, it became much easier for me to detect this quality when I scanned through new music.\n\nHere's an example: [Nimble](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/72IFsjh0fDGX39uLocWyWr?si=d59b94e6f42a4313). This is a sprightly, light-footed quality in music. In terms of timbre and rhythm, it is like a fairy--fast, light, fluttery, delicate. For some reason this is a quality I'm drawn to in music, but it doesn't already exist as a genre, so I had to discover it for myself. I did this by adding any song that gave me this feeling to a playlist. It started with 1 song (the first in the playlist), and has now built up to 27. Over time, the essential quality uniting these songs became more apparent, and I came to realize \"this is something I really like.\" I'm really good at spotting it now when listening to new music, and its led me into genres I didn't used to listen to, like hyper-pop.\n\nSo going off of what you said above, you're already doing something like that with Of Monsters and Men. You gave it the name \"whimsical folk-ish.\" I'm guessing there's a quality you recognize in their music, that you are giving that name to. I might create a playlist like that: \"Whimsical Folkish.\" Can you think of an image that captures this same quality? Make that the cover image--the cover will help you sustain focus on the quality. I actually look at my playlist covers when I listen to them because they help me recognize the quality each playlist is built around.\n\nThen write a blurb that captures whatever it is that draws you to this whimsical folkish type sound. Like the picture, this helps you sustain focus on this quality. In a sense, this \"genre\" of music doesn't fully exist yet--it's in a kind of fledgling state, so anything that helps you sustain focus on this nebulous quality is good.\n\nThen I would go to [Discover Quickly](https://discoverquickly.com/) and start exploring. Here's one strategy: type \"Of Monsters and Men\" into the search bar. Click on their name and once you get to their page on the site, click \"recommended songs based on Of Monsters and Men.\" This will give you a bunch of songs to explore. Mouse over them to listen to snippets of each song. See if anything in the 30-second snippet gives you that \"whimsical folkish\" feeling. If so, add it to the playlist for deeper listening later.\n\nYou could do something similar with the Arctic Monkeys song. What is it you like about that song in particular? Can you recognize the quality you're responding to? Give it a name and build a playlist for it with just that one song in it. Then go to Discover Quickly, search for that song and when you find it, click \"recommended songs based on this.\" Start scanning through them, adding any song that gives you a similar feeling to the playlist. If none of the songs offered give you that feeling, click the refresh button (curved arrow above top row of songs offered) to get more.\n\nYou're building out from what you already like, further differentiating it and using it as a bridge into new music . This helped me expand my taste from indie-rock into pop, country, hip-hop and r&b. If you look at my [playlist library](https://open.spotify.com/user/apeiron101?si=ac4fe90ff27946d2), all but the first and last one are build around a specific quality in the way I'm describing. Through doing this, my musical taste has expanded dramatically in a few years. A lot of the qualities that you discover you respond to will cross existing genres and serve as gateways for you into these new musical worlds."

It focuses less on genre rules and more on how it feels to move through them - rising and falling, flowing in arcs, etc.\n\nSpotify link here: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/74riQOLzJCLJDBWZwoCHat?si=zEkUZI3sTDyy5apgQuYTGw&pi=nn7R1TuhRW-sD\n\nIt balances atmospheric depth with playful energy the a few genres:\n\n**IDM & post-Dubstep:** Four Tet, Burial, Floating Points, Rival Consoles, Digitalism, Joy Orbison, Nosaj Thing, Aphex Twin (entry-level)\n\n**Nu-Jazz Mutations:** Floating Points, Portico Quartet, Moses Yoofee Trio, BY.ALEXANDER (Alex da Kid), Joomanji, St Germain\n\n**Left-field & Sample-driven Electronica:** Caribou, Maribou State, Bicep, Gidge, Bonobo, Against All Logic, Daphni, Jamie xx, Gramatik, Pogo, Gramatik\n\n**Ambient/Modern Classical:** Max Richter, Jóhann Jóhannsson, Ludovico Einaudi, Jon Hopkins, Slow Meadow, Jonny Greenwood, Max Cooper, etc.\n\n**Downtempo & Trip-Hop:** Massive Attack, Portishead, DJ Shadow, Bonobo, Air, Groove Armada, Moby, Mount Kimble\n\nYou can start anywhere in the playlist, but no shuffle!\n\nI’m always updating and refining it, so if you’ve got playlists in a similar space (or tips for curating long, flowing journeys) I’d love to hear them."

      "comment_text": "Hiii so I'm a experimental producer and I've just released my first song, is IDM/ambient, I've been wanting to release my music seriously for years, but I didn't feel confident enough for others to listen to it, however I decided to ignore the fear and release it. It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think! Thanks so much! Here's the link to the song on Spotify but it's on Apple Music, Deezer and almost all platforms too:\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/3porKsR3WhmOfJInQYXeK5](https://open.spotify.com/track/3porKsR3WhmOfJInQYXeK5)\n\n\n\nAnd my second song is already up exclusively to SoundCloud right now but going onto the other streaming services in like 15 days, here's the link:\n\n\n\n[https://soundcloud.com/kasprikkk/detached-stars-kasprikkk](https://soundcloud.com/kasprikkk/detached-stars-kasprikkk)"

What's notable about the genre is that instrumentals and vocal songs are at a relatively even proportion.\n\nMy contribution is the last track at #15, but they're all great!"

After the end of my long term relationship I'd gone on a date with someone who, by all accounts, was great. Unfortunately, my heart was elsewhere and I realised I couldn't give him what he deserved so I walked away.\n\nThis song is about owning that discomfort, about knowing that you're not right for someone, even if they feel like a great match. It's soft, layered and a little bittersweet. It also features a verse from rapper Dom-nlc, who's perspective gives the other side of the story - someone ready for love but feeling left behind.\n\nWould love to know what you think 💭\n\nMuch love, \nS-NIN"

      "comment_text": "1. Car Seat Headrest (indie rock, slacker rock)\n\nFavorite album (and my favorite album of all time): How To Leave Town, I just think it's their most ambitious and relatable project\n\nRecommended album: Twin Fantasy (Face to Face), most CSH fans who got into the band after 2018 started with this album, most people consider it their magnum opus, the songwriting is extremely personal and heartbreaking at times (especially on the last 3 songs), if someone wants to check out 1 song I recommend Beach Life-In-Death, it's just iconic\n\n2. Swans (post-rock, experimental rock)\n\nFavorite album: To Be Kind, it's their most consistent album front to back, every song is an experience on its own and together they make something unforgettable, whether you like this album or not, I doubt it'll leave you indifferent\n\nRecommended album: White Light from the Mouth of Infinity, it's one of their most accessible works but still one of their strongest, I think Blind is one of the most beautifully written songs in their discography so I would start with that song\n\n3. Weatherday (noise pop, emo)\n\nFavorite album: both of them, Hornet Disaster and Come In are equally fantastic, great riffs, passionate performances, interesting songwriting and it's all noisy and I love when music is noisy\n\nRecommended album: Come In, purely because it's the first one and it's shorter, My Sputnik Sweetheart is a song I'd recommend from this album, it's a 12 minute emotional rollecoaster and it basically has everything Weatherday offers\n\n4. AJJ (folk punk, indie rock)\n\nFavorite album: Knife Man, it's a little messy but it's filled with fun and memorable songs that will make you laugh at how fucked we are, plus Big Bird is such a beautiful song, it's very different from their other songs but it's a perfect closer for an album like Knife Man\n\nRecommended album: People Who Eat People Are The Luckiest People In The World, this album is the perfect representation of AJJ's sound, it's probably their most cohesive record and has their best songwriting"

So:\n\n1. Metric. An indie rock outfit from Canada. One reason I like them (aside from lead singer Emily Haines's voice and sharp lyrics) is that they don't repeat themselves; all of their albums are quite distinct from each other, even though they all have that essential \"Metric-ness\" I keep coming back for. My favorite album from them is *Pagans in Vegas*, although I get the impression from r/metricband that this is a minority opinion. (*Synthetica* seems to be much more of a favorite.) The Metric song that most people seem to have heard is \"Black Sheep\" (from *Scott Pilgrim*) but it is actually not that representative of their style overall. Some of my favorite songs from them include \"Celebrate\", \"Lie Lie Lie\", and \"The Governess\", all off *Pagans*, and none of which sound like each other; sampling from other albums, \"Gimme Sympathy\" (off *Fantasies*), \"Sick Muse\" (also *Fantasies*), \"On the Sly\" (*Grow Up and Blow Away*), and \"Risk\" (*Art of Doubt)* are all worth listening to, and the first four tracks of *Synthetica* (\"Artificial Nocturne\", \"Youth Without Youth\", \"Speed the Collapse\", and \"Breathing Underwater\") is one of the strongest album opener runs I've ever heard.\n2. The Joy Formidable. A trio from Wales. Also indie rock, but more guitar-oriented than Metric. The three of them and tiny lead singer/guitarist Ritzy Bryan are able to generate a lot of noise from a guitar, a bass, and drums. My favorite album from them (and current overall favorite album) is *Hitch*. Their song \"Liana\" is a good example of how they can go from soft to really loud over the course of one song.\n3. The Birthday Massacre, a Canadian goth/darkwave band. Think lots of synths and heavy guitars with electronic beats and mostly pretty vocals from lead singer Chibi, with occasional growling. My favorite album from them is still *Hide and Seek*, the one that introduced me to them, with \"Leaving Tonight\" and \"Down\" (with the aforementioned growling) being favorite tracks from it.\n4. Texas, a (despite the name) Scottish rock band. I would say they are indie rock too but they are more straightforwardly pop/rock than the others. My favorite album from them is probably *White on Blonde* which has many standout tracks, including \"Black-Eyed Boy\"; I can still remember hearing \"Black-Eyed Boy\" come up on the old [Last.fm](http://Last.fm) \"Neighbor Radio\" feature and being like, \"Who is *this*?\""

So:\n\n1. Metric. An indie rock outfit from Canada. One reason I like them (aside from lead singer Emily Haines's voice and sharp lyrics) is that they don't repeat themselves; all of their albums are quite distinct from each other, even though they all have that essential \"Metric-ness\" I keep coming back for. My favorite album from them is *Pagans in Vegas*, although I get the impression from r/metricband that this is a minority opinion. (*Synthetica* seems to be much more of a favorite.) The Metric song that most people seem to have heard is \"Black Sheep\" (from *Scott Pilgrim*) but it is actually not that representative of their style overall. Some of my favorite songs from them include \"Celebrate\", \"Lie Lie Lie\", and \"The Governess\", all off *Pagans*, and none of which sound like each other; sampling from other albums, \"Gimme Sympathy\" (off *Fantasies*), \"Sick Muse\" (also *Fantasies*), \"On the Sly\" (*Grow Up and Blow Away*), and \"Risk\" (*Art of Doubt)* are all worth listening to, and the first four tracks of *Synthetica* (\"Artificial Nocturne\", \"Youth Without Youth\", \"Speed the Collapse\", and \"Breathing Underwater\") is one of the strongest album opener runs I've ever heard.\n2. The Joy Formidable. A trio from Wales. Also indie rock, but more guitar-oriented than Metric. The three of them and tiny lead singer/guitarist Ritzy Bryan are able to generate a lot of noise from a guitar, a bass, and drums. My favorite album from them (and current overall favorite album) is *Hitch*. Their song \"Liana\" is a good example of how they can go from soft to really loud over the course of one song.\n3. The Birthday Massacre, a Canadian goth/darkwave band. Think lots of synths and heavy guitars with electronic beats and mostly pretty vocals from lead singer Chibi, with occasional growling. My favorite album from them is still *Hide and Seek*, the one that introduced me to them, with \"Leaving Tonight\" and \"Down\" (with the aforementioned growling) being favorite tracks from it.\n4. Texas, a (despite the name) Scottish rock band. I would say they are indie rock too but they are more straightforwardly pop/rock than the others. My favorite album from them is probably *White on Blonde* which has many standout tracks, including \"Black-Eyed Boy\"; I can still remember hearing \"Black-Eyed Boy\" come up on the old [Last.fm](http://Last.fm) \"Neighbor Radio\" feature and being like, \"Who is *this*?\""

Some of my favorite songs from them include \"Celebrate\", \"Lie Lie Lie\", and \"The Governess\", all off *Pagans*, and none of which sound like each other; sampling from other albums, \"Gimme Sympathy\" (off *Fantasies*), \"Sick Muse\" (also *Fantasies*), \"On the Sly\" (*Grow Up and Blow Away*), and \"Risk\" (*Art of Doubt)* are all worth listening to, and the first four tracks of *Synthetica* (\"Artificial Nocturne\", \"Youth Without Youth\", \"Speed the Collapse\", and \"Breathing Underwater\") is one of the strongest album opener runs I've ever heard.\n2. The Joy Formidable. A trio from Wales. Also indie rock, but more guitar-oriented than Metric. The three of them and tiny lead singer/guitarist Ritzy Bryan are able to generate a lot of noise from a guitar, a bass, and drums. My favorite album from them (and current overall favorite album) is *Hitch*. Their song \"Liana\" is a good example of how they can go from soft to really loud over the course of one song.\n3. The Birthday Massacre, a Canadian goth/darkwave band. Think lots of synths and heavy guitars with electronic beats and mostly pretty vocals from lead singer Chibi, with occasional growling. My favorite album from them is still *Hide and Seek*, the one that introduced me to them, with \"Leaving Tonight\" and \"Down\" (with the aforementioned growling) being favorite tracks from it.\n4. Texas, a (despite the name) Scottish rock band. I would say they are indie rock too but they are more straightforwardly pop/rock than the others. My favorite album from them is probably *White on Blonde* which has many standout tracks, including \"Black-Eyed Boy\"; I can still remember hearing \"Black-Eyed Boy\" come up on the old [Last.fm](http://Last.fm) \"Neighbor Radio\" feature and being like, \"Who is *this*?\""

Didn't go a single day without hearing the bloody song. For celebrations. For karaoke. For background noise. You name it, its on. AND THEN it was used in a Jim Beam advert on TV also. My ears now ring when I hear this song and I IMMEDIATELY turn it off!! 🤢🤢"
