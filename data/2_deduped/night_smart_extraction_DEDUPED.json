      "comment_text": "The first thing that came to mind is the German band Welle:Erdball that's very synth-heavy and often has a space feel to it. Some of their songs are marked with a C=64, which means those were created using no instruments other than a Commodore 64 console, so those are especially bloopy. The video you linked reminded me of [Space Oddity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQJdTDo0WE) in particular. You might like some of their other songs too, like [Ich habe in eine Zukunft gesehen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68mk5VfoRXo) (\"I've seen into a future\"). \n\nIf you're looking for instrumentals instead, you might like some songs by Dance With The Dead, like [Adrift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJyBcPu3K4).\n\nAlternatively, you could look for video game soundtracks, especially older ones. The [VVVVVV OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-baHj9N6dM) could fit what you're looking for. The [Dustforce OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXH5G_bqrlc) might be for you as well. (Unless you watch Chubbyemu on youtube. Then you might have a different association with some of those.)"

Occasionally attributed to Tablo feat Taeyang though.\n\nKpop star Taeyang released this song which became a huge hit in Korea and as a result Tablo from epik high took the song and not only reworked it into a hip hop song but he also changed it from korean into english.\n\nSo this isn't quite a cover so much as it's a remaining into  a whole other language, Tablo is a master lyricist in both Korean and English and this is one of my fav examples of his brilliant lyricism ( he has a masters in English from Stanford so it's not hard to imagine why his lyrics are so good)"

      "comment_text": "I've been using Apple Music for a while now after being a long-time Spotify user. I missed the recommendations and sometimes went back to check Spotify's Release Radar to find new releases that I'd like. Over time, and as I listened to more music, Apple Music's recommendations got better. I also favourited some artists so it would prioritise their new releases.\n\nI also like the Replay playlists and the human-curated genre and mood playlists. I just hope these don't get ruined by AI slop.\n\nOne of my pet peeves with Apple Music on the Mac is the some of the options like \"View in Library\", \"View in Apple Music\" or \"View in iTunes\" etc. I shouldn't have to care where the track/album is, just play the damn thing!\n\nOverall, I'm glad I moved. Though, it helps that my Apple Music subscription is bundled as a free add-on with my mobile phone plan."

      "comment_text": "I've been using Apple Music for a while now after being a long-time Spotify user. I missed the recommendations and sometimes went back to check Spotify's Release Radar to find new releases that I'd like. Over time, and as I listened to more music, Apple Music's recommendations got better. I also favourited some artists so it would prioritise their new releases.\n\nI also like the Replay playlists and the human-curated genre and mood playlists. I just hope these don't get ruined by AI slop.\n\nOne of my pet peeves with Apple Music on the Mac is the some of the options like \"View in Library\", \"View in Apple Music\" or \"View in iTunes\" etc. I shouldn't have to care where the track/album is, just play the damn thing!\n\nOverall, I'm glad I moved. Though, it helps that my Apple Music subscription is bundled as a free add-on with my mobile phone plan."

      "comment_text": "I've used a couple streaming services, here's my honest review of each.\n\nTidal: sound quality ia great and artist pay is as good as it gets for streaming. Its music catalogue is the same as the big players, and you can directly upload your own music if you want. Unfortunately, the app doesn't cut it for me. It's very network-sensitive. If I lose coverage for a second (basically any time I go on a drive for over half an hour), Tidal stops completely and you have to open the app to get music going again. \n\nSpotify: you never have to think about if the app will work or not, and it's very easy to share music with friends, since your friends are all on Spotify. Artist pay is not good and a lot of people don't like what the CEO funds.\n\nAmazon Music: if you dislike Spotify for business practices, Amazon is probably not much better for you. The app and catalogue are more or less fine, last I used it. Artist pay is usually higher than Spotify, but not as high as the companies that make it their calling card.\n\nNugs.net: awesome, if you're into its niche. Nugs is specifically for live music. It only has a few hundred artists on the platform, but it'll have dozens to hundreds of concerts for who they do have. \n\nBandcamp: not exactly a streaming service, but it's by far been the best to me as an artist. I made more from my first two sales on Bandcamp than my first 6000 streams on Spotify. It's not as known for discovering new music, but I've been reached out to by a magazine that found me there. It has less music available than streaming platforms, but a bunch of releases that aren't available elsewhere.\n\nMy usual strategy is to treat streaming as like a free sample, and then Bandcamp for buying a product."

He ain’t dead, he just won’t talk to me no more, last time was I think about seven or eight years ago. \n\nThere’s a very special kind of sorrow in this song, the kind of all encompassing sorrow that somehow contains joy, loneliness, respect, yearning, pride, pathos. It’s all there, and yet, you are the only one there to see it. \n\n“I can hear the sound of slamming doors and folding chairs\nAnd that’s a sound they’ll never know.”"
