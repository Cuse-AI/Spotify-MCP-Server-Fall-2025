There's a clear mismatch between the comment's subject (a female artist with a powerful voice) and the actual song being referenced. The comment appears to be about a different artist entirely, possibly Miley Cyrus given the song title reference, making it impossible to accurately determine the emotional sub-vibe intended for this specific Lil Culture track.",
