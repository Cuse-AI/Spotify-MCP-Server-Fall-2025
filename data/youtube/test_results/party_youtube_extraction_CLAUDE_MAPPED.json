This paradoxical nostalgia (sometimes called 'anemoia' - nostalgia for a time you've never experienced) suggests the song evokes wistful, bittersweet feelings about the '00s dance era. Justice's 'D.A.N.C.E.' is from 2007 and represents the French electro house movement of that decade. While the song itself is upbeat, the human's emotional response is centered on nostalgic longing rather than energetic celebration, making 'Sad - Nostalgic Sad' the most accurate classification for their specific emotional experience with this track.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The artist's direct quote reveals the song emerged from a profound existential moment - looking up at the stars, feeling like 'a tiny speck in this infinite solar-system,' and questioning God's existence. While loneliness is mentioned, the dominant emotion is philosophical contemplation about existence, purpose, and one's place in the universe. The nighttime imagery ('looking up to the stars,' 'came to me one night') combined with deep introspective questioning ('wondering if God exists') perfectly aligns with contemplative nighttime reflection rather than pure loneliness or sadness. The song captures that specific feeling of late-night existential pondering.",

The phrase 'wenomechainsama tumajarbisaun wifenloof' is a popular internet meme that mimics misheard lyrics, often used ironically or humorously. The comment claims to have 'almost cried' at this part, but since these are not actual lyrics from Calvin Harris's 'Summer,' this seems to be either trolling, joking, or posted on the wrong song thread. Without genuine emotional context about how the actual song affected the listener, I cannot accurately map this to a specific emotional sub-vibe.",

The post title mentions 'Party Music Hits' but the comment contradicts this by describing a calm, solitary weekend. There's a clear disconnect between the emotional context (relaxing at home, watching anime), the song's actual energy (hard-hitting rap/party music), and the post title.
