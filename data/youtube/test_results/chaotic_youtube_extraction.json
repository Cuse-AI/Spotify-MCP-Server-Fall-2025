This has all been a pleasant surprise for me which I can't thank you guys enough for.\r\n\r\nHowever, accompanying the feeling of thanks is the feeling of guilt. I really do hope this little project of mine won't stop Jack Stauber from making his own original video for Buttercup, if he had planned to do so in the first place. Truthfully, the reason why this video is as popular as it is now is because the timing of its upload perfectly coincided with Stauber's significant boosts in popularity. Being the multi-talented artist that he is, the existence of this already-popular video may have lost him a chance to create his own rendition for a Buttercup video.\r\n\r\nSo I do hope most of the praise that goes toward this video goes to him as well. Let's not forget of course the talents of Masaaki Yuasa and company, the brilliant minds behind the animation used in this video, KICK-HEART. The only praise I personally should be receiving is my combination of these two already-wonderful elements into a single item.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

Back then we had to go to an arcade to play video games. We had drive in theatres and stone washed blue jeans. No internet, instead we actually had real friends who liked to do crazy things to have fun. Friday and Saturday nights we even went to the skating rinks. Oh it was so much fun, especially when you eyed that pretty girl you were scared to talk to. No we didn't text back then, there were no smart phones or cell phones. Back then you actually called a girl, if you had the nerve, and asked her out on a date. To top it all off the movies were great and so was TV back when everyone was always trying figure out what JR Ewing was up to on Dallas. We only got to see cartoons on Saturday morning, then after that we played outside all day trying to find an old tire to push down the hill to see it bounce. We played outside all the time. A wonderful time to be a kid, especially when you finally heard your favorite song from Casey Casem top 40 on the radio. If you were focused, you would record the song from the radio onto a tape recorder, LOL!!!",

Do you like them?\" I told her I've never heard of them. She opened it and put it on the turntable and cranked it up. I fell in love with the band from the first song. Mom said it's a good thing your dad is at work. He'd yell at both of us. I  said you bought it, opened it and put it on then cranked up the  volume. Not me. Gave her a hug and thanked her. Miss you mom and dad. See you soon.",

      "comment_text": "When I was 16, after 10 years of compulsory public education, I watched a couple of friends leave to further their tertiary educations overseas, while I could only get a local polytechnic diploma. 2-3 years after that, I watch more friends walk proudly into various local universities, while my educational journey came to an end. I came from a poor family and my father could only send me for basic education and nothing more as I had 3 younger siblings who were still schooling. After 3 years in the military, I began working and became the family bread winner. I never stopped working for almost 25 years and slowly climbed up the career ladder. A few years ago, I hear this song and it struck a cord in me. I decided it was time. I enrolled in graduate school at 45. Next to the lecturer, I was the oldest person in class. Everywhere I went on campus, I stood out like a sore thumb. Everyone was on laptops and tablets, while I was on books, papers and pencils. But I didn't give up, I kept turning to this song to keep me going. THIS was MY fight song. I struggled hard but help soon came. Classmates half my age who once spurred the 'old dude' from groups in class, turned to me for life advice and in turn, helped me navigate the digital world and gadgets and online submissions. I still turned to this song to keep the fire going when I wanted to give up.\n\nI graduated last year, ahead of schedule, 4 years out of a 5 year part time degree programme. My parents couldn't make it as they were too frail. There was no one in the audience clapping for a 49 year old graduate. But I was proud. I had made it. And this song was one of those songs that just kept me telling myself ... I can do this!",
