Life has been good thought for the most part, you're able to hear songs like this and think back whether it's good or bad memories we are here today because of it all and our resilience.

I overdosed a year ago and was dead for over 10 minutes, by the grace of God I was brought back to life without brain damage. I recommitted my life to Christ a little over a month ago and haven't went back to my old life ever since. Christ has given me hope and it's a miracle he brought me back. He saved me and I will love Him forever for that. He's showed himself to me through many spiritual experiences in the last 40 days that I've been sober. I've been transformed into a new creation. He can do the same thing in your life. Jesus can save you too. Invite Him into your heart and never look back. I was lost but now I'm found.",

Don't be away from His love. He misses you.\nAs a Christian all my life, I was on fire and then enter my very attractive ex-partner - I backslid. I did drugs, had sex with very good looking men, was popular, partyied, was an adrenaline junkie, hill bombing skate boarder. \nAnd still, NOTHING compared to Jesus. His presence. His peace. The Holy Spirit. His love. It drew me back, now His love, joy and peace are my banner.\nTime is short and hell is real but God's arms are open wide.\nPray(Aloud is best if you are comfortable) \"Jesus, I need you. Please forgive me of my sins and come into my heart. I give my life to follow You and to live for You daily. Thank you Lord that You hear me, You are faithful and You love me'.\nThank you, God is so pleased with you.\nContinue on by reading His word, getting good Christian friends and being established in a good church and to grow in Christ become sensitive to His voice by being obedient when He speaks to you gently about cutting certain things out of your life.\nGod bless!",

When I was 14 years old, he was diagnosed with cancer, and they told him he wouldn’t live to the end of the year (it was August)\n\nHe lived for two more years, defying everything the doctors had told him. \n\nHe died surrounded by his family, and his last words to me were, “never stop playing, can you please, play for me? And not forget me? Can you do that for me?” \n\nAt his funeral, I was asked if I would play a song, and I chose to play this song, the song he played while I would sit on his lap. The song that could bring back a thousand memories. \n\nAnd now, 8 years later, I sat down at the piano with my beautiful 2 year old girl, who we decided to name Claire, and played this song for her.",

I want to feel every possible feeling and keep adrenaline in my system. And when I noticed these things and I thought hard about what I wanted to do with myself and my life, I changed as a person. I became more ambitious and wanted to pick up a book for the first time in my life, learn the piano maybe pick up a language. And it changed everything...but it really did all start with this song.",

Now after all our struggle and after she's had her fun, she wants back in. It hurts, but after careful consideration I have advised her to stay.....stay gone, stay away. Sad but kind of happy at the same time. God, this song reminds so much of all the times I begged her to love me. In the end it was for the best.  Great song",

He even had to work nights for a few years, something that he really didn't want to do but did it. Sad to say we grew up without a mom and times were tough, but we pulled through because of him.

It turned out that she had a natural ability and wound up playing the guitar and writing music  throughout her teenage years.  It saved her.  She's now 27 and a nursery school teacher. And still an a huge Taylor fan.  Taylor's music got her through those very turbulent years.  We enjoyed many Taylor Swift concerts together throughout the years.  Thank you, Taylor....  :-)",
