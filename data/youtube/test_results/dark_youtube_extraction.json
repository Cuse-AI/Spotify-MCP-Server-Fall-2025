      "comment_text": "I was lucky enough to be the recording engineer on this session. Dave Allen (producer of some great Cure albums, Sisters Of Mercy amongst others) was producing. Prior to recording the whole album at Jacobs Studio near Farnham, Hampshire. The band came down to West Side studios in west London to record three songs with Dave Allen. Dave's concept for this project was that the band should all play together and nail the songs live with no overdubs. This proved pretty difficult for the band who weren't seasoned studio pro musicians - I'm not sure how much they'd played live at that point. I think we might have had three weeks - a week per song to record three songs? I remember feeling very sorry for the band because they were just playing the songs over and over and over again and Dave would be saying 'sorry, not quite there yet - try that again'.  I was wondering if Dave would cave in with his concept and do what was normal with this kind of band,  concentrate on getting a good drum recording first and then build up everything on top of that, one instrument and vocal at a time. I don't remember him caving -  if he did, it was not for a long time. I remember a lot of tension in the band because if anyone screwed up we would stop the recording and they would start the song again. I realized though when we started the whole album recording a few weeks or months later, that although it was a very tough approach by Dave, it transformed the band. When they came back to the studio, they were a much tighter, well rehearsed band. I can't remember what the other two songs were that were recorded at the same time as Swamp Thing but this was by far the best song of the session and my favorite on the album. Such amazing guitar riffs and incredible mood.",

All those adventures... all the wonders of discovery we shared, every new person encountered, and every lesson learned.\n\nIt's funny how time flies, you know?\n\nIt seems like only yesterday we were little kids, running around with sticks in our hands and buckets on our heads, \"The brave, knightly duo.\" Patrolling the streets of our childhood home in ignorance of the world around us...\n\nWhere did all that time go? Back then, we were able to pull through anything, *do* anything we set our minds to.\n\nTen years have passed since you were taken away from me, from the life we lived, the memories we shared and the joy we earned in our travels. And though I stand here now, alone, old and crippled... nothing has changed.\n\nYou were my best friend. \n\nEven in death, you're *still* my best friend. \n\nAnd nothing will change that.",

These wicked black claws have dug the graves of endless corpses. Even this snout, stained by the blood of all my victims, is dangerous, for with it I find all of my prey. Does the sight of me not induce dread, child?\n\nGirl: I don’t fear you for I cannot see you. I am blind. \n\nWolf: Then, is the sound of my voice, my snarl, not enough? \n\nGirl: Hearing you speak, all I sense is a lonely creature. \n\nWolf: You’d dare insult me? \n\nGirl: It’s okay to be lonely. I’ve been alone all of my life, trapped in my world of darkness. I know your pain.\n\nWolf: No one has ever spoken to me this way... So, you do not care that I am a monster?\n\nGirl: You are not a monster. You’re just lonely. \n\nWolf: I... I am so terribly lonely. You are the first to ever acknowledge me as anything but a monster... I shall spare you, child, for, even without your sight, you can see far more than anyone I’ve ever encountered before. You can see the heart, the spirit. You can see my soul. \n\nThe Girl reaches out her hand. The Wolf steps forward, lowering his head and pressing it against her palm. \n\nWolf: Thank you, my child.\n\nThe Wolf backs away and disappears into the dense woods. The Girl hears him leave and continues along the path, sure that though she can no longer hear him, the lonely Wolf remains close and watches over her, protecting her.",

But then I realized there was an elegance to it, and what are vampires if not a hybrid of horror and elegance? Though not the perfect marriage of the two tones, I can appreciate having realized that both are present in a way that fits reasonably well with the title. ",
