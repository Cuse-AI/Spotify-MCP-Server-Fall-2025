He wanted me to keep it. I looked at him a bit funny at first. He told me one of his closest friends went out on a mission and didn't make it back. Let's leave it at that. When they found him and his things, his iPod was stuck on \"The Bleeding\". The last thing he was listening to before he went was one of our songs. I literally teared up. I had no words at the time. It gives new life to your soul that you mean so much to another person. Growing up, music was all I had so it speaks volumes.” - Ivan Moody",

Yes, I'm well aware that he is alive. ( the beginning is actually the ending ) My comment was me merely trying to relate to the mv, specifically the part where he just accepts that he's drowning i.e he's not trying to save himself. I feel that every single day; I drown and do nothing about it, even worse, I actually hope that I'll just die. Unfortunately, I don't ( clearly, as I'm typing this lol. ghosts cant type )\n\nI read this in a Wattpad book \"Forcefully Yours\" and might as well share it with yall. It sounds something like this ( not the exact words bcs I'm lazy to refer back lmao )\n\" I'm not alive bcs I deserve it, I'm alive bcs staying alive is my punishment. I'm not alive bcs I did something to deserve it, I'm alive bcs dying would be an easy way out.\"\n\nSo that's that. #tpwk\n\nLove, H.\n\nPs// biggest flex ever : my name starts with h too lol. love yallll.",

But to be honest it, applies to a lot of people that I’ve known throughout my life. I don’t hold hate or anger towards anyone. Maybe I used to, but it’s just too draining of an emotion and this song is about making peace with those situations - Oli",
