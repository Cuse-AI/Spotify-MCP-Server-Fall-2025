      "comment_text": "The moral of this song and story  really for anyone who is wondering. Justin Vernon, the singer, was on a bridge with his brother on Christmas Night. He was feeling really down that day, but as he stared across the empty highways ‘for miles, miles, miles’ at roads ‘thick with ice’, he realised in that moment it’s ok to feel this way. He realised ‘at once he was not magnificent’ as he gazed up at the huge starry sky and a landscape similar to the huge vast ones of the ancient Holocene, but at the same time as he said in an interview about the song, he may have realised then that he isn’t a main character on the grand scheme of things, but he’s still ‘special, yet not special’. Jesus this song is just so beautiful, and it’s something we need to all realise. We can’t all be main characters, but you are your own main character and you are to someone else as they are to you. We all have our own little corner of this Holocene, we are all unique and special. It’s easy to feel insignificant as Vernon did, but when he took in the beauty of those surroundings, he came to realise he was lucky to just witness it all with his brother beside him, and how rare it is really just to exist, and that shouldn’t be taken for granted by seeing yourself as insignificant.",

This is quintessentially contemplative content, specifically occurring at night with themes of self-reflection, acceptance of difficult emotions, and finding perspective through observing vast landscapes. The nighttime setting, the solitary introspection, and the philosophical epiphany all align perfectly with the contemplative night sub-vibe.",

My family tree literally ends where I sit. I listened to this song the other night with my headphones, very loudly. I must’ve listened to this at least two dozen times in succession. It never tired or got old. It still doesn’t. I am hurting so much right now, more than I ever thought possible but THIS song is my loving companion for now. I love it and I love FINK for creating it.

The song captivated them so completely during this road trip that they didn't switch songs until reaching their destination. This is a quintessential road trip experience where a song becomes the soundtrack to a long drive.

The song title 'Strange' and artist Celeste (known for soulful, emotional delivery) combined with this context suggests a reflective, bittersweet sadness about how relationships can come full circle.

This is a classic heartbreak sentiment, focusing on the asymmetry of emotional attachment after a relationship or connection has ended. Joji's 'Glimpse of Us' is a song about remembering a past love while being with someone new, which perfectly aligns with this inability to forget someone. The specific mention of 'not being able to forget' combined with the one-sided nature ('already forgotten about you') makes this distinctly about heartbreak rather than general sadness, loneliness, or nostalgia.",

The commenter explicitly describes the song being played at their 27-year-old son's funeral, and this being the first time in 5 years they've had the strength to listen to it again. The imagery is profound: memorial lockets with 'never fade away,' describing the listening experience as 'a dagger going through my heart but needing to feel the pain.' This transcends general sadness or melancholy - it's specifically about mourning the loss of a loved one, processing bereavement, and the complicated relationship with music that's tied to profound loss. The song has become permanently linked to their grief journey.",

Except be mad at you\nThen tell you that “you’ve sinned a bunch of times but I’ve forgiven you” \nYou know they won’t admit it and god himself has forbid it but it’s probably still just half of all the shit the priest committed \n\nAnd how does that mak-\n\nAsk me one more fucking time how the fuck I feel \nImma fucking lose my mind, step aside I need the pills\nStep aside I need the xannies\nStep aside I need the vicodin \nAnd I’ll be on my way so I can just get back my life again \nYou do not give a shit...stop pretending stop lying\nCause to you I’m just a check, bitch just a dollar sign...\nAnother vacay with the kids, hubby couldn’t be prouder...\nAnd all you had to was ask me how I feel for an hour \nSee that’s the problem with pretentious technicalities \nYour preach insanity and then expect my weekly salary?\nSo tell me who’s the crazy person now bitch...\nAnd yet you think you’re qualified to treat me? Shit \n\n(Chorus)\nI’ve given it my all\nI’ve given it my all and so much more\nBut everybody’s still walking out that door\nI’ve given it my all\nIt’s getting to the point where it’s sad as fuck\nI’ve given it my all but it’s not enough...\nIt’s not enough\n\nOutro\n\nMan I came up a long way\nJust a young Jozi nigga\nBullet at my temple\nAfraid I might pull this trigger \n\nThis fucking anxiety \nFucking anxiety \nMy demons are calling and saying that they want whatever's inside of me...\n\nImma give it to em, (Hell yeah) Imma give em’ all of it \nUse to be a smooth operator...\nNow it's the opposite \n\nAnxiety...\nOh big time\nAnxiety yeah\nI feel it swimming thru my veins, I’m afraid I might get the blade, make a slit and let the blood spill out\nAnxiety...\nOh big time\nAnxiety",

Then when I was 7, my mom was diagnosed with cancer. My depression started there because I didn't see her a lot, she was in and out of the hospital. My mom survived cancer and I started having weight problems. I got bullied a lot in elementary school but I didn't tell anybody. I ate because I was hurting, I had nobody. Then my best friend in my neighborhood moved away. That felt like a punch in the stomach. When I was 11 I got into middle school and I was emotionally/verbally abused by my grandmother from August 2017 to July 2018. From August 2017 to February of 2018 I was suicidal and had 2 failed suicide attempts. I'm now in a program at my school where I am learning two years ahead and it's a lot of pressure on me. I've been wanting to get out of that program for 1 month now. But my mom said no and now she is verbally abusing me. This still happens everyday but luckily I have my 3 best friends by my side. You probably won't read all of this but if you did... thank you so much!\n\n7 months later(12 almost 13): WTF 2K LIKES!? And all of the replies and support from people makes me so happy and and helps me realize there are good people in the world! Thank you to the people who wrote some of the replies. You guys helped me through this and I'm doing so much better! I will try and subscribe to all of you as a thank you!\n\n1 year later(13 years old): Holy shit. 3.7k likes, I can't believe this! This is... amazing\nI ant to thank all of you, all of you were there when some other people should have been, I love you all!\n\nAlmost 2 years later (9/1/2020) 14 years old: Damn. I'm back here for reasons I feel horrible about. My life had gotten worse but now I know I have people to help me and I know that I can fight through this.

The song '1-800-273-8255' by Logic (the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number) directly addresses suicidal ideation, depression, and mental health crisis. The post title explicitly lists 'depression' as a core theme. While the song has hopeful elements and a message of choosing life, the context is clearly centered on depressive states rather than grief, loneliness, or general melancholy. The metaphor about colorblindness captures the numbness and inability to experience joy that defines clinical depression, making 'Sad - Depressive' the most accurate sub-vibe.",

Not physically (although I did bite my tongue a few weeks ago so bad that I couldn’t eat normal for a week xD), but mentally. I did suffer from depressions already many years ago and they have come back to me kind of like waves. Some months, even years I felt better, others I felt really bad again. When I was in my teens I even got to a point where I became suicidal, but thank God that’s over for good. Especially because of Carina, since she came into my life I have never thought about suicide anymore, ever.^^ The depression stuff never really went away though, and in the past one or two years it has slowly crept back into my head, first I barely realized it but the past months it became very obvious. My mistake was that I tried to tell myself that I’m not depressed and I didn’t do what I should have done, which is to open up, let it out, and not trying to “be strong”, because it only makes you weaker in the end. Depression also has that really annoying side effect that it kills all your creativity, energy, willpower, all of it. I sat down many times at the keyboard and just stared at my fingers. I had nothing, there was not even the spark of an inspiration. That’s also why I didn’t make a new song for so long, I simply couldn’t. Not until I finally had the inspiration for this song right here, a sad, emotional song. And it took a long time for that. This is also what happened to me 5-6 years ago, and it helped me to feel better (I’m talking about the old songs like Death Dance, Beyond the Veil etc.). Anyway… making this song was really important, I feel like it’s the first step I’m doing forward again towards the light and away from the darkness. So I’m sorry that I was gone for so long, but at least now you know why. Please don’t be surprised if there will be some more dark songs than usual at the moment, I just think I need to let them out, it’s kind of like sucking out a poison for me.\n\nI hope you’re all in good health and that you have a wonderful day, whatever you’re doing and wherever you are. =) Please don’t worry about me, as I said the fact that I made this song is the first step of healing, so the worst is behind. =)\nTreat each other well and I’ll see you soon!",

While 'Night - Contemplative' was mentioned in the post title, the actual emotional context is much deeper and darker - this is about active depression and mental struggle, not peaceful contemplation.

My Papa Lear- my mom's dad- passed away January 19th this year from Alzheimer's. I know he is watching over me as well. I try to live every day the way my mom would want me to.

Anyway, I went to Seattle about 6 months later for a check up. They told me I had qualified for a bone marrow transplant. I was terrified. I knew it was going to help, but I was afraid something would happen. Anyway, I went to this camp, and I still had not made my decision. When this song was performed, I decided to get it done, and to trust God. I've been in Seattle since Mid December, and after multiple complications, I am finally getting admitted in to to hospital on Wednesday. Yes, I am terrified, but without this transplant, I will not live much longer. After another year, I will finally be able to go out to college. Miracles can happen, you just have to trust God <3",

They describe this as God answering their prayers 'miraculously.' This is a clear celebration of a deeply meaningful spiritual milestone - a conversion/salvation moment that the person had been praying for. The emotional tone is one of jubilant celebration and gratitude for what they perceive as a miraculous answer to prayer. While the post title mentions 'contemplative Christian Music,' the actual emotional context of the comment is celebratory rather than contemplative, making 'Happy - Celebration' the most fitting sub-vibe for this joyful, answered-prayer moment.",

The emphasis on positivity combined with the song title 'Back Home' (which typically evokes warm, uplifting feelings) strongly suggests a feel-good emotional experience. The context comes from a thread about philosophical songs, but the commenter's focus is on the positive, uplifting nature of the music rather than melancholic contemplation or other emotional states. This aligns perfectly with the Happy - Feel Good sub-vibe, which captures positive, uplifting music that makes listeners feel better.",

The song's core message is about carefree enjoyment and seizing the moment without worry, which perfectly aligns with the Happy - Carefree sub-vibe.

The emphasis on 'starring role' indicates active awareness and thought about identity and existence, which fits the contemplative night-time introspection sub-vibe better than pure melancholy or other options.

Given the song's iconic status and its themes of romantic longing, combined with the nostalgic quality it holds for listeners familiar with 90s Bollywood music, this maps best to a romantic sub-vibe with nostalgic undertones. However, since 'Romantic - Nostalgic' isn't explicitly listed, the closest match would be 'Romantic - Long Distance' due to the song's theme of love across separation.",

This is a clear expression of grief and loss related to a deceased parent. While 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' has comforting, spiritual qualities that could fit other categories, the context of funeral wishes, the passage of time (7 years), and the ongoing expression of missing their mother makes this definitively about grief rather than general sadness, nostalgia, or melancholy. The song served as a final tribute and continues to carry the weight of that loss.",

      "comment_text": "Scarborough is a small town on the coast of England. The \"Scarborough Fair\" was a popular gathering in Medieval times, attracting traders and entertainers from all over the country. The fair lasted 45 days and started every August 15th. In the 1600s, mineral waters were found in Scarborough and it became a resort town. Today, Scarborough is a quiet town with a rich history. (thanks, Sheryl - Seal Rock, OR)\nIn Medieval England, this became a popular folk song as Bards would sing it when they traveled from town to town. The author of the song is unknown, and many different versions exist. The traditional version has many more lyrics.\nPaul Simon learned about this song when he was on tour in England, where he heard a version by a popular folk singer named Martin Carthy. When Carthy heard Simon & Garfunkel's rendition, he accused Simon of stealing his arrangement. Carthy and Simon did not speak until 2000, when Simon asked Carthy to perform this with him at a show in London. Carthy put his differences aside and did the show.\n\nMartin Carthy learned the song from a Ewan MacColl songbook, and had recorded it on his first album, according to BBC's Patrick Hamphries.\n\nPaul Simon admitted to the July 2011 edition of Mojo magazine: \"The version I was playing was definitely what I could remember of Martin's version, but he didn't teach it to me. Really, it was just naivety on my part that we didn't credit it as his arrangement of a traditional tune. I didn't know you had to do that. Then later on, Martin's publisher contacted me and we made a pretty substantial monetary settlement that he was supposed to split with Martin, But unbeknown to me, Martin got nothing.\"\nThe lyrics are about a man trying to attain his true love. In Medieval times, the herbs mentioned in the song represented virtues that were important to the lyrics. Parsley was comfort, sage was strength, rosemary was love, and thyme was courage.\nThis was not released as a single until 1968, when it was used in the Dustin Hoffman movie The Graduate. It is on the soundtrack.\nBefore Simon & Garfunkel got to it, Bob Dylan used the lines, \"Remember me to one who lives there, she once was a true love of mine\" in his 1963 song \"Girl From The North Country.\"\n\"Scarborough Fair\" and \"Canticle\" are 2 songs that are sung simultaneously to create this piece. The first and last verses are \"Scarborough Fair,\" but lines from \"Canticle\" alternate after the first line of the other verses, so \"On the side of a hill in a deep forest green\" and \"Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested ground\" are from \"Canticle.\"\nThis song is often listed as \"Scarborough Fair/Canticle.\" On The Paul Simon Songbook, a little known 1965 UK album of Simon-solo demos, there is a song called \"The Side Of a Hill.\" \"The Side Of a Hill\" was reworked into the Canticle part of \"Scarborough Fair.\" (thanks, Jesse - Roanoke, VA)\nWith its implicit anti-Vietnam War message, this was used in The Wonder Years TV series in a scene where Kevin Arnold embraces Winnie Cooper while the song was played at the end of the episode. In the show, Winnie's brother had been killed in Vietnam. (thanks, Marciliano - Fortaleza, Brazil)",

This framing evokes longing for a bygone era and the bittersweet nature of historical memory. The mention of 'Bards would sing it' reinforces the folk tradition aspect - a song passed down through generations that carries the weight of history and collective memory. This combination of historical storytelling and folk music tradition strongly suggests a nostalgic, wistful emotional quality rather than purely informational content.",

The enthusiastic discovery tone ('so happy for having discovered you') and emphasis on philosophical depth suggests this fits the reflective, thought-provoking nature of contemplative music rather than purely sad or romantic categories.",

While the song's message offers comfort ('nothing's gonna hurt you, baby'), the context is explicitly about mourning and memorializing a deceased child. This goes beyond melancholy or nostalgic sadness - it represents profound grief and loss, even though the commenter has found some peace in believing their son is no longer in pain. The song serves as both a lullaby that was never fully realized and a tribute to a life cut short.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The commenter is describing a profound memory from the early 1980s at Telluride, recalling being mesmerized by Nanci Griffith's performance. Key phrases like 'I remember,' 'A pure moment,' and the vivid sensory details ('tender texture of her voice,' 'mountains calling from behind her') all indicate this is a nostalgic recollection of a beautiful past experience. The emotional tone combines wistfulness for a moment gone by with appreciation for its beauty - the 'powerful grace and vulnerability' of the performance. This is quintessentially nostalgic: looking back on a tender, meaningful memory with both fondness and the bittersweet awareness that it exists only in the past. The song 'Love At The Five & Dime' itself is also a nostalgic narrative about young love and the passage of time, which aligns perfectly with this emotional frame.",

This of course, is coming from a long time professional drummer, and child of the 70's who grew up listening to songs like this on the radio ;)) . Other examples of \"heartbeat ballads\" would be songs like Billy Joel's \"Just the Way You Are\",\nThe Bee Gee's \"How Deep Is Your Love\", and Chicago's \"If You Leave Me Now\", The Carpenters \"Close To You\", and of course, this one.. All great tunes that will always be remembered for their honesty, emotional depth, gorgeous musical arrangements, and peaceful and melancholic ambiance..",

      "comment_text": "I met Philip Glass when I first arrived in NYC, after having lived abroad for 7 years in Central Europe.  In fact, it was very odd meeting.  I had been given a comp ticket to attend a \"kiddie concert\" at Carnegie Hall, I don't remember what orchestra was playing, and it featured the music of Philip Glass.  So I had a great seat, in fact, a box seat in one of those side boxes looking right out over the stage.  And I'm sitting there in the morning before the concert is about to begin, and who should sit down behind me, but Philip Glass along with his wife.  At the end of the concert, attended by all those school kids, I got up and I turned and said to Mr. Glass, \"My father ( member of the percussion section of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra) is a great fan of your work, Einstein on the Beach.  I would like to buy him the cd of the opera, but there are two versions, the original version from 1976 and the updated later version.  Which do you recommend?\"  And he said, \"I personally prefer the original version from '76.\"  And he put his hand on my shoulder when he said that.  And I thought, Glass is not at all like his image makes him, somewhat cool, austere, he's actually a very warm person when you meet him in person.  I've also met John Cage in person, and spent an afternoon talking to him and playing chess with him, while his cat, Skookum, jumped on the chess board every now and then (and never knocked over a piece amazingly), and the same could be said of John Cage, very friendly warm person, but unlike Glass, Cage was much more impersonal.",
