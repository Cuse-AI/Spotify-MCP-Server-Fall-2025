The comment is about appreciating someone's acting/performance rather than describing the emotional vibe or feeling the song evokes. Without information about how the song makes the commenter feel or what emotional experience it provides, I cannot accurately map it to a specific sub-vibe.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The post title indicates 'Funny songs 😂' but the comment text is empty, providing no specific emotional context about why this particular song (Don't Give It Away by Fridayy featuring Chris Brown) was recommended as funny. Without the comment explaining what makes this song humorous to the user - whether it's the lyrics, the music video, a specific moment, or the overall vibe - I cannot determine the actual emotional sub-vibe. Additionally, 'funny' is not a standard emotional category in the available sub-vibes list, and the song itself is actually an R&B track about relationships, not typically categorized as a comedy song. More context is needed to map this to an appropriate emotional sub-vibe.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The comment appears to be a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure reference (specifically from Stardust Crusaders arc) quoting dialogue from a dramatic/comedic scene. While the song title matches the anime arc and is composed by Yugo Kanno (who scored JoJo), the comment itself is a meme quote rather than a genuine emotional expression about the music. The quote involves dramatic crying/calling for help but is commonly used in humorous anime fandom contexts. Without clear indication of the actual emotional experience the human has with this music (beyond recognizing it as mischievous anime soundtrack), there's insufficient genuine emotional context to map to a specific sub-vibe.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "While the post title 'Mischievous music' suggests a musical context, the comment is actually a humorous parody rewrite of the Team Fortress 2 Sniper's 'Meet the Sniper' monologue from the perspective of frustrated players. The text is about gaming frustrations (not switching classes, being votekicked, team composition issues) rather than describing the emotional qualities or context of the linked song 'Mr. Fast 2witch' by Tp & Esco. There's no clear indication of how this song relates to the gaming commentary or what emotional experience the human associates with it.

The human is requesting a music sheet for 'Mischievous Kiss: Love In Tokyo OST' (which appears to be a Japanese drama soundtrack), but the validated Spotify track is Drake's 'Push Ups' - a diss track/rap song with aggressive, confrontational energy. The comment 'Please share me this music sheet' suggests the human wants sheet music for a romantic drama OST, not Drake's rap track. There's no emotional context about Drake's song itself, and the entire post seems to be a data validation error or mismatch between what was requested and what was identified.",
