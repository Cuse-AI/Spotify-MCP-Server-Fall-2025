Thank you CGPGREY' appears to be about the difficulty of locating a song (possibly referenced by CGP Grey, a popular YouTuber/podcaster), but provides no emotional context about how the song makes them feel or what mood/vibe it creates. The post title 'Frantic Assembly Playlists' suggests this may be related to theater/performance company playlists rather than personal emotional expression. Without any description of the song's emotional impact or the listener's feelings when hearing it, I cannot accurately map this to a specific emotional sub-vibe.",
