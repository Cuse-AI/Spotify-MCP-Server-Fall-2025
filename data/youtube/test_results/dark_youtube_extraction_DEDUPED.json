      "comment_text": "I was lucky enough to be the recording engineer on this session. Dave Allen (producer of some great Cure albums, Sisters Of Mercy amongst others) was producing. Prior to recording the whole album at Jacobs Studio near Farnham, Hampshire. The band came down to West Side studios in west London to record three songs with Dave Allen. Dave's concept for this project was that the band should all play together and nail the songs live with no overdubs. This proved pretty difficult for the band who weren't seasoned studio pro musicians - I'm not sure how much they'd played live at that point. I think we might have had three weeks - a week per song to record three songs? I remember feeling very sorry for the band because they were just playing the songs over and over and over again and Dave would be saying 'sorry, not quite there yet - try that again'.  I was wondering if Dave would cave in with his concept and do what was normal with this kind of band,  concentrate on getting a good drum recording first and then build up everything on top of that, one instrument and vocal at a time. I don't remember him caving -  if he did, it was not for a long time. I remember a lot of tension in the band because if anyone screwed up we would stop the recording and they would start the song again. I realized though when we started the whole album recording a few weeks or months later, that although it was a very tough approach by Dave, it transformed the band. When they came back to the studio, they were a much tighter, well rehearsed band. I can't remember what the other two songs were that were recorded at the same time as Swamp Thing but this was by far the best song of the session and my favorite on the album. Such amazing guitar riffs and incredible mood.",

With the method he used, he was dead after about 30 minutes, probably unconscious around 12 minutes. I like to think that it was peaceful for him with his music on.

Im so happy that so many people replied, thank you for all the conversations. Bipolar and depression are not spoke about enough, thank you for shining a light into the darkness and continuing a conversation about it.\n\nYou never understand why so many people fail to stick with their treatment until you live that life. Once you start down that path all you want is to be free of it and to feel again.\n\nThis song is so much deeper than anyone can understand.",

He joins, thinking he's doing the right thing. Instead, he finds out war is hell and he's not fighting for freedom, he's fighting against the oppressed around him. Instead of being this paragon of freedom that he thought he would be, he saw himself as the one causing it. This song isn't against servicemembers. It actually tries to sympathize with them, while making the statement clear that war is terrible for all sides and that the justification of \"We're protecting democracy\" just isn't true when it's really just to further the interests of business and that we have lost our humanity far enough that he killed a child. This song has far more respect for servicemen and women around the world as it shows the reality of what they may have to face.",

They were now middle aged in the late 1950's and at the top of their game. There was a bunch of these guys doing studio work at  big record labels like Capitol and the movie studios. This generation of musicians was a peak in educated talent with taste. It passed away not long after with the Counterculture explosion. \r\nMancini was a genius.",

Going around some obstruction to the left of the room after unlocking the door you will find a vent. After this, you will find the record playing beside a bloody wastrel hammering something to the wall. Be careful since she will attack you if she notices you. You will also find a good weapon and an advanced first aid kit here too.\n\nEdit: Wow, I forgot I even commented this. Has it really only been one year?\n\nBtw when you’re playing as Ollie and you reach the hatch in Apple Holm/Parade District, theres another record player in the corner of the room next to the bed, which may or may not be another song from Contrast.

So why'd she feel like she had to hire the likes of me to help her figure out who was coming after her? Add that one to my endless list of burning questions. I prayed that getting them answered would see me still alive by morning, then set about preparing what needed to be done, downing one last shot of scotch for luck. \nI decided to start by paying a visit to Dick Konklin. Konklin was a sleazy, shifty sort of guy with a history of blood and murder that would make Jack the Ripper squeamish. That didn't matter right now. I needed information, and my gut was telling me that Dick was the one to give it to me. Plus, I knew where to find him. Of course, that was part of the problem, because where I could find him was in the back room of a cockroach-infested dive bar that opened into a dark alleyway in a part of town with a lot of secrets to keep, not to mention some real talent in keeping them. I'd have to watch my back and play straight, or the only question I'd get answered tonight would be whether or not there's an afterlife. I checked the rounds in my piece just in case, slipped it into my coat pocket, and stepped out the door into the night.",

The ticket for entrance was 9 cents, popcorn cost a nickel, cold drink cost a nickel, candy bar cost a nickel, and I still had a penny left over for gum.  The movie?  The Third Man!  I was eight-years-old and sat there entranced throughout the movie, spellbound by the action,  and had a lifetime memory forged by the music.  Anton Karas' zither played in my head for weeks after the show left town.  I'll tell you...when Orson Wells and Joseph Cotton started ascending into the air on that gigantic ferris wheel, I nearly had a heart attack as a kid; I couldn't wait for the carriage to get back down. Whenever Alida Valli appeared in a scene, that zither music slowed down and became so melancholy, it made a lasting impression on me.  And when I saw either Siskell or Ebert (I can't remember which) asked by Johnny Carson on Carson's show what the critics' favorite all-time movie was and the answer came, \"The Third Man\", it stirred up memories thick as molasses. I loved it then; I love it now--70 years later. That was the best quarter that I have ever spent.",

I mean just look at my face. \nJim: I think you look great. \nJeremiah: And I'd like to speak to Bruce again. We couldn't really talk, what with his girlfriend bleeding out all over him. \nJim: You tried to prove you're better than your brother but I'm still here. The city's still here. You're a failure Jeremiah. Enjoy Arkham. Your brother did. Put him in the box. \nJeremiah: Bring me Bruce Wayne and I'll tell you where the other bombs are. \nJim: We have all your bombs. \nJeremiah: The maze bombs yes. I meant the other bombs. Jim, as an engineer you expect systems to fail so you build in redundancies. And I am a very good engineer. You're right though. I did fail. I didn't understand the vision I was servicing but I do now. My eyes are opened as will yours be.",

I went on to listen to many other styles of music after that and didnt pay attention to the bmss type stuffs. Didnt think there was a loose movement of this type of stuff going on until I found your page. Glad you can keep me up to speed. I'm def a crate and internet music digger, but I dunno where you find this stuff. And what's with all \"dark and edgy\" symbolism? I still dont get if these bands are about that stuff, just using the symbols because  of there pre wwii pagan meanings, or is it just to piss people off like punks joking around  in the 70s. Usually psychedelics produce a sense of oneness and connection to all.....not trippy supremacy. This is just an overall comment about the music in general and not towards this post. Maybe I'm just getting boomered and dont understand the kids anymore.\n♥️💣✌🎃🤘💣♥️\nCan you help me clarify?",

But it was a liberating feeling over me when I woke up. I had new insight, my visualizations are better. I'm more thoughtful... I thank the very kind and polite \"demons\" that I met with in my dream world for being amazing escorts and hosts into \"hell\" but I see it instead as the underbelly of my mind. My fears have dissapated and I have a new respect for life beyond what I can sense in a conscious state. Thank you.",
