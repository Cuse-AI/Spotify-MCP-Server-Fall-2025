I was out of town when I got the news, but once I got home his brother helped me deal with the loss. We are both alright, but every now and then it's clear that both Popi (my dog) and I both miss our furry little buddy, which is okay. It's important to cherish the moments we have with our companions. Please refrain from arguing about religion, as everyone regardless of their beliefs mourns when someone they care about dies. The existence or nonexistence of an afterlife doesn't change the fact that we are on earth now, and we should enjoy the time we spend with others. \nStay safe and stay hydrated!",

      "comment_text": "I know most people think of this song as a song about poverty and trying to overcome it but for me this song reminds me to keep fighting. I am half deaf and when I was younger nobody really believed I could be anything other than dumb. I had teachers tell me that I would never learn to read, I was excluded for being unteachable and I wasn’t allowed to use my hearing aids. One teacher even used to purposely break them but I never wanted them to be right so I worked twice as hard than everyone in my class and I did well in school. This song always reminds me that I have come so far and to not let others break me as I have fought through things that would have made most people give up. If anybody is struggling in any situation they are in you do have the strength to fight it and it might take years before you win but if you persevere you will win",

I thank Coldplay for saving me.  I thank Guy, Jonny, Will and Chris for writing and sharing this masterpiece to the world.",
