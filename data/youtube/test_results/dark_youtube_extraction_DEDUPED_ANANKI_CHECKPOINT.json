The lyrics depict emotional distance and disconnection within an intimate relationship ('millions of miles between us laid on the same bed'), references to substance use as coping mechanisms, and a cold, isolating atmosphere ('Iron curtain those sheets that divide us', 'solid silence'). The artist Plastique Noir is a darkwave/goth band, and the song title 'Rose of Flesh and Blood' itself evokes gothic imagery. The emotional tone is dark, romantic in a melancholic way, and fits squarely within gothic aesthetics - exploring themes of emotional alienation, substance dependency, and the haunting nature of being physically close yet emotionally distant from someone.",

Prior to recording the whole album at Jacobs Studio near Farnham, Hampshire. The band came down to West Side studios in west London to record three songs with Dave Allen. Dave's concept for this project was that the band should all play together and nail the songs live with no overdubs. This proved pretty difficult for the band who weren't seasoned studio pro musicians - I'm not sure how much they'd played live at that point. I think we might have had three weeks - a week per song to record three songs? I remember feeling very sorry for the band because they were just playing the songs over and over and over again and Dave would be saying 'sorry, not quite there yet - try that again'.  I was wondering if Dave would cave in with his concept and do what was normal with this kind of band,  concentrate on getting a good drum recording first and then build up everything on top of that, one instrument and vocal at a time. I don't remember him caving -  if he did, it was not for a long time. I remember a lot of tension in the band because if anyone screwed up we would stop the recording and they would start the song again. I realized though when we started the whole album recording a few weeks or months later, that although it was a very tough approach by Dave, it transformed the band. When they came back to the studio, they were a much tighter, well rehearsed band. I can't remember what the other two songs were that were recorded at the same time as Swamp Thing but this was by far the best song of the session and my favorite on the album. Such amazing guitar riffs and incredible mood.",

With the method he used, he was dead after about 30 minutes, probably unconscious around 12 minutes. I like to think that it was peaceful for him with his music on.

The imagery of a ghostly couple possessing living bodies to dance together for one night combines Gothic romance with dark, supernatural elements. The organ version of 'The Vampire Masquerade' perfectly fits the Gothic aesthetic - it's dark and atmospheric but centered on romantic longing rather than pure horror. The masquerade ball setting, vampiric theme, and tragic romantic narrative of separated lovers are quintessentially Gothic, blending darkness with beauty and melancholy romance.",

The comment emphasizes how depression and bipolar disorder 'are not spoke about enough' and describes the difficult reality of living with these conditions. The song title itself references lithium medication, and the emotional context is clearly about the depressive aspects of mental illness, the struggle with treatment, and the yearning to escape emotional numbness.

'Drunken Dwarves' by Wind Rose is a power metal song with humorous, fantasy-themed lyrics celebrating dwarf culture in a lighthearted way. The emotional context is clearly about enjoyment, entertainment, and finding music that aligns with their gaming interests in a fun, celebratory manner rather than something serious, intense, or aggressive.",

The comment 'The Bogeyman checks under his bed for Tom Waits' emphasizes the artist's deeply menacing, fearsome quality - suggesting something so dark and unsettling that even nightmarish creatures fear it. 'God's Away On Business' by Tom Waits is a chaotic, industrial-influenced track with dark carnival energy that fits the apocalyptic theme perfectly - it's about moral decay and a world spinning out of control in the absence of divine oversight. The combination of end-times context and the song's actual thematic content makes Dark - Apocalyptic the clear match.",

The comment's brevity ('Where people, where comment') suggests the commenter is surprised by the lack of engagement on something they find emotionally resonant, which aligns with the cult following nature of TEOTFW. The song itself is a 1967 soul track that evokes a vintage, nostalgic feeling perfectly suited to the show's emotional landscape of young people searching for meaning and connection.",

The song evokes both nostalgia (through its classic 50s sound) and sadness (through its lonely, wistful themes), making it a perfect match for the show's exploration of broken characters finding connection.

The mention of 'medieval king' and 'poor philosopher' combined with the dystopian playlist theme suggests a post-apocalyptic or dark future setting where these archetypes might emerge. The Dark - Apocalyptic sub-vibe best captures this dystopian emotional landscape.",

He joins, thinking he's doing the right thing. Instead, he finds out war is hell and he's not fighting for freedom, he's fighting against the oppressed around him. Instead of being this paragon of freedom that he thought he would be, he saw himself as the one causing it. This song isn't against servicemembers. It actually tries to sympathize with them, while making the statement clear that war is terrible for all sides and that the justification of \"We're protecting democracy\" just isn't true when it's really just to further the interests of business and that we have lost our humanity far enough that he killed a child. This song has far more respect for servicemen and women around the world as it shows the reality of what they may have to face.",

The narrator discusses how the song sympathizes with a soldier who thought he was fighting for freedom but discovered he was actually oppressing others - a profound philosophical disillusionment. This isn't aggressive protest music but rather contemplative storytelling that invites the listener to reflect on complex moral questions about service, propaganda, and the nature of freedom versus oppression. The 'dystopian playlist' context and the emphasis on perspective-taking and understanding the psychological journey makes this a deeply philosophical, introspective piece rather than angry or energetic.",

While 'Dark - Villain Arc' was considered, the quote's emphasis on victory, breaking chains, and the triumphant nature implied by the title 'this is Epic' better aligns with the empowering, powerful energy of epic soundtracks. The Sith Code represents an active philosophy of gaining power rather than purely villainous intent, making this more about powerful, epic intensity than villainy specifically.",

The song (Tommee Profitt's dark cover of 'Can't Help Falling In Love') combines romantic themes with a dark, dramatic atmosphere. 'Dark - Haunting' best captures this emotional space - it's the intersection of beautiful melancholy and emotionally evocative darkness that lingers with the listener, creating those vivid, tragic narrative daydreams the commenter describes. While 'Sad - Crying' relates to the tears mentioned, the primary emotional driver here is the dark, atmospheric quality that makes the song hauntingly beautiful and emotionally cinematic, not simply sad.",

While the comment itself is cheerful and well-wishing for Christmas, the actual playlist context is what defines the emotional intent of the song selection. 'Fire On Fire' is a powerful ballad about intense, burning love from the 'Watership Down' soundtrack, and its placement in a sad love songs collection suggests it's being experienced through the lens of heartbreak or lost love. The song's themes of passionate, all-consuming love combined with its categorization as a 'sad love song' makes 'Sad - Heartbreak' the most appropriate sub-vibe.",

This is a textbook example of nostalgic reflection on simpler, more carefree times in youth. The song 'Used To Be Young' by Miley Cyrus directly addresses this theme of looking back at one's younger self. While there are elements of acceptance ('I wouldn't change anything'), the primary emotional driver is the bittersweet nostalgia for a time when life was different and they had more freedom and vitality. This fits 'Sad - Nostalgic Simpler Times' better than 'Sad - Nostalgic Teen Years' (which is more specifically adolescent-focused) or general melancholy categories.",

I prayed that getting them answered would see me still alive by morning, then set about preparing what needed to be done, downing one last shot of scotch for luck. \nI decided to start by paying a visit to Dick Konklin. Konklin was a sleazy, shifty sort of guy with a history of blood and murder that would make Jack the Ripper squeamish. That didn't matter right now. I needed information, and my gut was telling me that Dick was the one to give it to me. Plus, I knew where to find him. Of course, that was part of the problem, because where I could find him was in the back room of a cockroach-infested dive bar that opened into a dark alleyway in a part of town with a lot of secrets to keep, not to mention some real talent in keeping them. I'd have to watch my back and play straight, or the only question I'd get answered tonight would be whether or not there's an afterlife.

The ticket for entrance was 9 cents, popcorn cost a nickel, cold drink cost a nickel, candy bar cost a nickel, and I still had a penny left over for gum.  The movie?  The Third Man!  I was eight-years-old and sat there entranced throughout the movie, spellbound by the action,  and had a lifetime memory forged by the music.  Anton Karas' zither played in my head for weeks after the show left town.  I'll tell you...when Orson Wells and Joseph Cotton started ascending into the air on that gigantic ferris wheel, I nearly had a heart attack as a kid; I couldn't wait for the carriage to get back down. Whenever Alida Valli appeared in a scene, that zither music slowed down and became so melancholy, it made a lasting impression on me.  And when I saw either Siskell or Ebert (I can't remember which) asked by Johnny Carson on Carson's show what the critics' favorite all-time movie was and the answer came, \"The Third Man\", it stirred up memories thick as molasses. I loved it then; I love it now--70 years later. That was the best quarter that I have ever spent.",
