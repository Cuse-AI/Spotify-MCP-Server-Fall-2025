The lyrics depict emotional distance and disconnection within an intimate relationship ('millions of miles between us laid on the same bed'), references to substance use as coping mechanisms, and a cold, isolating atmosphere ('Iron curtain those sheets that divide us', 'solid silence'). The artist Plastique Noir is a darkwave/goth band, and the song title 'Rose of Flesh and Blood' itself evokes gothic imagery. The emotional tone is dark, romantic in a melancholic way, and fits squarely within gothic aesthetics - exploring themes of emotional alienation, substance dependency, and the haunting nature of being physically close yet emotionally distant from someone.",

Prior to recording the whole album at Jacobs Studio near Farnham, Hampshire. The band came down to West Side studios in west London to record three songs with Dave Allen. Dave's concept for this project was that the band should all play together and nail the songs live with no overdubs. This proved pretty difficult for the band who weren't seasoned studio pro musicians - I'm not sure how much they'd played live at that point. I think we might have had three weeks - a week per song to record three songs? I remember feeling very sorry for the band because they were just playing the songs over and over and over again and Dave would be saying 'sorry, not quite there yet - try that again'.  I was wondering if Dave would cave in with his concept and do what was normal with this kind of band,  concentrate on getting a good drum recording first and then build up everything on top of that, one instrument and vocal at a time. I don't remember him caving -  if he did, it was not for a long time. I remember a lot of tension in the band because if anyone screwed up we would stop the recording and they would start the song again. I realized though when we started the whole album recording a few weeks or months later, that although it was a very tough approach by Dave, it transformed the band. When they came back to the studio, they were a much tighter, well rehearsed band. I can't remember what the other two songs were that were recorded at the same time as Swamp Thing but this was by far the best song of the session and my favorite on the album. Such amazing guitar riffs and incredible mood.",

With the method he used, he was dead after about 30 minutes, probably unconscious around 12 minutes. I like to think that it was peaceful for him with his music on. I love you Darius, I'll miss you everyday for the rest of my life",

The imagery of a ghostly couple possessing living bodies to dance together for one night combines Gothic romance with dark, supernatural elements. The organ version of 'The Vampire Masquerade' perfectly fits the Gothic aesthetic - it's dark and atmospheric but centered on romantic longing rather than pure horror. The masquerade ball setting, vampiric theme, and tragic romantic narrative of separated lovers are quintessentially Gothic, blending darkness with beauty and melancholy romance.",

The comment emphasizes how depression and bipolar disorder 'are not spoke about enough' and describes the difficult reality of living with these conditions. The song title itself references lithium medication, and the emotional context is clearly about the depressive aspects of mental illness, the struggle with treatment, and the yearning to escape emotional numbness.

'Drunken Dwarves' by Wind Rose is a power metal song with humorous, fantasy-themed lyrics celebrating dwarf culture in a lighthearted way. The emotional context is clearly about enjoyment, entertainment, and finding music that aligns with their gaming interests in a fun, celebratory manner rather than something serious, intense, or aggressive.",

The comment 'The Bogeyman checks under his bed for Tom Waits' emphasizes the artist's deeply menacing, fearsome quality - suggesting something so dark and unsettling that even nightmarish creatures fear it. 'God's Away On Business' by Tom Waits is a chaotic, industrial-influenced track with dark carnival energy that fits the apocalyptic theme perfectly - it's about moral decay and a world spinning out of control in the absence of divine oversight. The combination of end-times context and the song's actual thematic content makes Dark - Apocalyptic the clear match.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "This song 'Care a Little' by Bernadette Carroll is from The End of The F***ing World soundtrack, a cult TV series known for its deeply nostalgic, bittersweet aesthetic. The show uses vintage songs to create a wistful, melancholic atmosphere that reflects on youth, disconnection, and simpler times. The comment's brevity ('Where people, where comment') suggests the commenter is surprised by the lack of engagement on something they find emotionally resonant, which aligns with the cult following nature of TEOTFW. The song itself is a 1967 soul track that evokes a vintage, nostalgic feeling perfectly suited to the show's emotional landscape of young people searching for meaning and connection.",

The song evokes both nostalgia (through its classic 50s sound) and sadness (through its lonely, wistful themes), making it a perfect match for the show's exploration of broken characters finding connection.

While the comment itself focuses on describing someone's trustworthy appearance (possibly the artist or a character in the video), it's placed within an explicitly dystopian thematic context. Of Monsters and Men's 'Crystals' is an atmospheric, haunting track that fits dystopian themes. The mention of 'medieval king' and 'poor philosopher' combined with the dystopian playlist theme suggests a post-apocalyptic or dark future setting where these archetypes might emerge. The Dark - Apocalyptic sub-vibe best captures this dystopian emotional landscape.",

He joins, thinking he's doing the right thing. Instead, he finds out war is hell and he's not fighting for freedom, he's fighting against the oppressed around him. Instead of being this paragon of freedom that he thought he would be, he saw himself as the one causing it. This song isn't against servicemembers. It actually tries to sympathize with them, while making the statement clear that war is terrible for all sides and that the justification of \"We're protecting democracy\" just isn't true when it's really just to further the interests of business and that we have lost our humanity far enough that he killed a child. This song has far more respect for servicemen and women around the world as it shows the reality of what they may have to face.",

The narrator discusses how the song sympathizes with a soldier who thought he was fighting for freedom but discovered he was actually oppressing others - a profound philosophical disillusionment. This isn't aggressive protest music but rather contemplative storytelling that invites the listener to reflect on complex moral questions about service, propaganda, and the nature of freedom versus oppression. The 'dystopian playlist' context and the emphasis on perspective-taking and understanding the psychological journey makes this a deeply philosophical, introspective piece rather than angry or energetic.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "There is a significant mismatch between the comment context and the validated song. The comment text appears to be lyrics from a gothic/theatrical song about bullfighting (with German phrases like 'Oh was fur ein fest' and references to matadors, carnations, and arenas), which would align with 'Dark - Gothic' given the post title 'Best Gothic Music Videos of All Time'. However, the Spotify validation identifies the song as 'Feed The Kids' by Ty Farris, which is a hip-hop track about street life and survival - completely unrelated to the gothic bullfighting lyrics quoted. This disconnect suggests either a validation error, mistaken song identification, or the comment being completely off-topic from the actual song. Without being able to trust the relationship between the emotional context and the actual song, I cannot confidently assign a sub-vibe.",
