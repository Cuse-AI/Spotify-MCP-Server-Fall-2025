Jessie Reyez's 'FIGURES' is a well-known emotionally raw breakup track that expresses anger, betrayal, and hurt following a failed relationship. While the title mentions 'angry,' the core emotion being processed is heartbreak - the pain of a breakup being channeled into artistic expression. The sub-vibe 'Sad - Heartbreak' captures this perfectly as it encompasses the emotional devastation of a breakup, which can include anger as one of its manifestations.",

This song channels fury into confident, assertive energy - it's about standing up and expressing rage without holding back.

      "ananki_reasoning": "The post is specifically asking for 'Angry/Empowering Breakup Songs' and the human's comment quotes a powerful lyric about sacrifice and realizing self-worth after a relationship ('Besides the Kids, I had Nothing to Show'). Mary J. Blige's 'Not Gon' Cry' is a classic empowerment anthem where the protagonist refuses to cry over a failed relationship despite the pain and sacrifice. The wine glass emoji and 'damn that was heavy' indicates recognition of the song's emotional weight, but the context of seeking 'empowering' songs suggests this is about strength and self-assertion rather than sadness. While the song has heartbreak elements, its primary emotional intent in this context is about reclaiming power and confidence after being undervalued in a relationship - which aligns with Energy - Confidence rather than any Sad sub-vibe.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "Marilyn Manson's cover of 'Personal Jesus' is recommended in a thread about angry songs and praised as 'one of the best covers in the history of covers.' Manson's interpretation transforms Depeche Mode's original into a heavy, industrial rock version that fits his signature dark, gothic aesthetic. While the context mentions 'angry songs,' Manson's version is more characterized by its brooding, dark intensity and gothic industrial sound rather than pure aggression. The combination of Manson as the artist and the context of anger channeled through his distinctive gothic-industrial style makes 'Dark - Gothic' the most fitting sub-vibe.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The comment expresses a bittersweet emotional state - crying with 'happy tears' while reflecting on living through past years. The mention of being '98 years old' and 'crying myself to sleep' combined with gladness about having lived through those times indicates deep nostalgia mixed with sadness. While posted in a 'Betrayal songs' thread, the actual emotional expression is more about looking back on life and relationships with mixed emotions - the sadness of time passed combined with gratitude for the experiences. Journey's 'Faithfully' is a classic power ballad about long-distance love and commitment, which fits perfectly with this nostalgic, reflective emotional state of remembering past love and life experiences.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The song title 'Is It Just Me?' suggests feelings of isolation and questioning whether one's emotional experience is unique or shared by others - a core characteristic of loneliness. The context places it in a 'Sad Songs Playlist 2024,' confirming the melancholic emotional territory. The phrasing 'Is It Just Me?' is a common expression of feeling alone in one's emotions or experiences, which distinguishes this from general heartbreak or crying and points more specifically to the lonely sub-vibe where one feels emotionally isolated or unsure if others understand their feelings.",

While the comment has a hopeful resolution about finding 'the best version of me,' the song itself was written during that depressive episode and captures that specific emotional state.

The song 'One Man's Dream' by Yanni - a gentle, contemplative instrumental piano piece - is being used during a moment of profound sadness and crying. While the song itself is beautiful and could be healing, the emotional state described goes beyond simple sadness or melancholy - the person explicitly mentions not feeling worth anything anymore, which indicates depressive feelings. The 'survivor songs' title suggests this music is helping them process trauma, and the instrumental nature of Yanni's work often provides space for deep emotional release during depressive episodes.",

This expresses the bittersweet pain of losing friendships - not through death (which would be grief), but through drift and distance. The emphasis is on cherished memories that once brought joy but now evoke sadness because those connections are lost. Kodaline's 'All I Want' paired with this context about losing friends creates a reflective, wistful emotional tone that looks back on what was beautiful but is now gone. This is distinct from pure melancholy or loneliness - it's specifically about the ache of remembering better times with people who are no longer in your life.",

Sada Baby, which doesn't match the Papa Roach parody reference at all. Without knowing if the user is genuinely recommending this as angry music or making a joke, and given the disconnect between the parody lyrics and the actual song, there's insufficient context to accurately map this to a specific emotional sub-vibe.",

However, the Spotify validation shows the song is 'Attack' by Disciple, which is a dubstep/heavy electronic artist known for aggressive, high-energy music - completely opposite to Kygo's tropical house/chill style.
