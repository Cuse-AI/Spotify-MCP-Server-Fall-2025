I sang...like I always do...or did...doing Billy Joel or Elton John. The people there seemed to like it. My wife...after several vodka and tonics...decides to do this song. I'd heard her sing at home before. So i was very much afraid. From the very first words...my jaw dropped!! I couldn't believe what I was hearing!!  She nailed it...and then some!  I'll never forget it. The crowd went nuts...as did I. Every time I hear this song ...I think of her. And how i know it was never about me. Thanks for posting.",

We were already separated at the time.  When we were exchanging time with our son the feeling was always there.    A few years later, 2016, she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer.  She had  passed away 8 months later in 2017 1 week before her birthday after our son wanted me to ask her if she wanted to go to the aquarium with us during my vacation time with him.   I thank God that she accepted. It felt like nothing even happened the whole day, we were a family unit again... \"not broken, just bent\"",
