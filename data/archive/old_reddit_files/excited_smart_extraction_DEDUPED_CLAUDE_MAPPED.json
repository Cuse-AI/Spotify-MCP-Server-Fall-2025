Despite its somewhat subversive subject matter for its time, the song maintains a catchy, cheerful energy that made it a feel-good classic rock staple.

This killed a lot of interest from listeners. And there has also been soooo much music recorded that one could listen to music constantly and never hear the same thing twice over several lifetimes. It may take me the rest of my life just to get Thru [Fela Kuti](https://youtu.be/q2E32KsPWhs?si=04FaSoCW0gOMD7-X)'s catalog.\n\nHowever technology has always disrupted the music industry and continues to do so. The barrier for entry of the musician to \"release\" music has not ever been lower.  [Steve Lacy](https://youtu.be/x-OzspEcQG8?si=a74xK3FMQI8UbHFn) made his \"Steve Lacy's Demo\" EP using just a phone and a couple instruments, nearly 10 years ago. His [TED talk](https://youtu.be/SUnmrQfdYpg?si=eNB4sCEhMkVqB0Ce) shows that you shouldn't let lack of fancy stuff stop you. The new technology means that more *good* new music is being produced now than at any time ever, and in all genre.  It can be overwhelming to navigate an ocean of new and old music.\n\nThat change isn't all sunshine and roses.  The fall of the recording studio proper also carries with it some loss in production knowledge.  A lot of new things aren't as \"slick\" sounding as older releases.  But the music is strong.\n\n[Folk](https://youtu.be/TCsFgJsJ5Uc?si=X8XJjfy9RZcBt6dJ) and [jazz]( https://youtu.be/fsjC8xYW9l8?si=kG-D3XmD5j8VnzAa) are each on fire right now. Throwback Bossa Nova artist [Pedro Mizutani](https://youtu.be/eXAUrGi4s7o?si=uuFphb3hrToYFs40) can tour Europe performing, powered by TikTok views.  \n\nOne that very strongly resonated for me is [Ginger Root](https://youtu.be/PiOdGpR0TdU?si=ZlhxJ5clfqzBsGk3)'s album from last year, *Shinbangumi*, blending Japanese City Pop with throwback 1980s television aesthetics and great storytelling.

The fact that they mentioned preferring '90s to 2010 electronic music' yet recommended this modern Subtronics track (who is a contemporary dubstep producer) suggests they may be experiencing nostalgic feelings even within the EDM realm - possibly this track evokes the heavier, more aggressive electronic sounds they loved from earlier eras.

The recommendation list emphasizes gothic/dark wave aesthetics with themes of curses, murder ballads, carnage, shadows, and killing - all fitting the Halloween brief.

This recommendation appears in a list alongside other classic rock tracks that lean toward introspective and emotionally powerful songs (Joy Division's 'Transmission', Bowie's 'Heroes', Deep Purple's 'Soldier of Fortune'). The song's structure - starting softly and building to powerful crescendos - paired with its heavy thematic content about mortality and conflict, makes it perfect for late-night contemplative listening where you're processing deeper thoughts and emotions.

While Joy Division is known for darker themes, 'Transmission' specifically channels raw energy and defiant spirit with its driving rhythm and commanding presence.

The title itself suggests reminiscence, and Social Distortion's signature sound combines punk energy with country-tinged melancholy that looks backward at a difficult past.

      "ananki_reasoning": "The song 'Vem kan segla förutan vind' (Who can sail without wind) is a traditional Swedish/Finnish folk song known for its melancholic, reflective nature about longing and separation. The context pairs it with Vivaldi's Winter (which evokes cold, stark beauty) and Marie Fredriksson's 'Mot okända hav' (Towards unknown seas), suggesting the human is seeking music with a wistful, contemplative sadness. The song's lyrics traditionally ask 'Who can sail without wind? Who can part from a friend without crying?' - expressing a gentle, beautiful sadness rather than acute grief or heartbreak. This aligns perfectly with melancholic music that carries emotional depth and reflective sorrow, enhanced by its traditional folk arrangement and cultural resonance.",

The 'Chill - Jazz' sub-vibe best captures the essence of this track as a cerebral, improvisational jazz piece meant for attentive listening rather than background ambiance.",

The other recommendations (Jino Inagaki's Soul Media and The Budos Band) further confirm this aesthetic - groovy instrumental music with jazzy, funky, or psychedelic elements that stimulate without overwhelming.",

'Tears' and 'Grins' by Charli xcx, Caroline polachek basically screaming in tears and then grins basically being one continuous chorus. 'Forever Winter' by Taylor swift, with her speaking to one of her friends the night they committed. and  'its just us now' by Sleigh bells, the lead singer screaming how she cannot live without this person. 'Thoughts' by Charli xcx, her vocals and the production is just amazing\n\nMost of these are some of my favourite songs from these artists too",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The human is specifically requesting songs where female artists are 'pouring the emotion out' with intense vocal delivery and emotional catharsis. Key phrases like 'AMAZING vocals,' 'screaming,' artists 'basically screaming in tears,' and references to dramatic bridges with powerful build-ups all point to raw, cathartic emotional release. The title reference 'All I Wanted' by Paramore is known for its climactic vocal outburst. Charli XCX's 'Thoughts' fits this pattern of intense emotional vulnerability and vocal intensity. This goes beyond general melancholy into the territory of active emotional release and catharsis that aligns with the 'crying' sub-vibe - not necessarily literal crying, but that level of raw, unfiltered emotional expression.",

This suggests deeply emotional, introspective music that conveys sadness through personal vulnerability rather than acute heartbreak or active crying.

The context of 'albums that got you through high school' combined with spending time in their girlfriend's bedroom listening to music creates a strong nostalgic frame. 'Angels/Losing/Sleep' by Our Lady Peace was specifically associated with intimate, personal memories from their youth. The retrospective nature of remembering these albums years later, and the emotional weight of music that 'got you through' a challenging time period, points directly to nostalgic sadness rather than current heartbreak or pure melancholy. This is bittersweet remembrance of youth and past relationships.",

While this could fit 'Party - Club' or 'Party - Dance,' the 90s house aesthetic has a slightly more intimate, groovy vibe that aligns better with house parties rather than massive club settings. The track's genre designation as house music makes this a clear party/dance context.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The human describes the album/song as 'Pretty heavy this week,' which indicates emotionally weighty, introspective content. Little Simz is known for deeply personal, thought-provoking hip-hop with complex lyrical themes. The term 'heavy' in music discourse typically refers to serious, contemplative subject matter rather than sadness or energy. The song '101 FM' from the 'Lotus' album features introspective spoken-word interludes and reflective production that aligns with late-night contemplative listening. This fits the contemplative sub-vibe better than purely sad categories, as 'heavy' suggests depth and reflection rather than grief or heartbreak.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The song title 'Gri Bölge' translates to 'Gray Zone' in English, which strongly suggests an in-between emotional state - neither clearly happy nor intensely sad, but rather existing in ambiguity and uncertainty. The color gray and the concept of a 'zone' evoke feelings of melancholy, being stuck in liminal emotional space, and contemplative sadness. This aligns perfectly with the melancholic sub-vibe, which captures that bittersweet, reflective, and somewhat somber emotional territory. The artist is sharing this as a personal release after 4 years of making music, suggesting this is a meaningful emotional expression rather than an upbeat or energetic track.",

This is a clear heartbreak narrative focused on relationship breakdown and betrayal. While there are elements of melancholy and potentially contemplative night vibes given the digital communication angle, the core emotional intent is the pain of a relationship ending due to infidelity from both parties. The 'digital infidelity' and 'read receipts' imagery specifically evokes the modern heartbreak experience of seeing messages acknowledged but ignored, which is a distinct heartbreak emotion rather than general sadness or loneliness.",

The fact that it's being shared in a 'Music Melting Pot' thread as a work-in-progress with a reflective tone about the production choices points to a chill, lofi vibe rather than something energetic or emotionally intense.

Even if they're playing mellower music from the 90s it wouldn't have that effect on your generation and a lot of older Gen-X folks.  Twenty years ago it probably would've been more 1950s music, but in another decade or two they'll probably shift forward to more 80s & 90s music.",

That's why I want to be upfront about the process and how I use it:\n\n* My lyrics are purely mine. My thoughts, my stories, and my personal experiences are the absolute starting point. I also compose all melodies on the piano first.\n* I use AI not as a ghostwriter, but as a powerful tool for rapid experimentation and sound design. Using tools like Suno Studio for rapid stem manipulation, I can instantly audition my core piano melody across dozens of instrumentations and genres. This allows me to explore and commit to a final arrangement much faster than I could using traditional software, without having to manually score or re-record every part. I guide and direct every step.\n* After the AI helps me explore and choose the best direction, I spend extensive time editing, mixing, and fine-tuning to ensure the track retains the emotional weight and personal touch of the original melody.\n\nMy goal is to take something fundamentally human and amplify its impact through technology, creating tracks that are personal, immersive, but uniquely a product of my own direction - I'm hoping that stands out with my songs. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on this process (and I promise the word \"neon\" will never show up in any of my music).\n\nAlso, any feedback on the above track from my Soundcloud would always be appreciated!",

The human describes 'Postales del Sur' - an album of 6 simple, intimate acoustic pieces for ronroco and charango (South American string instruments) released September 12, 2025. However, the Spotify validation shows a completely different song: 'Tragic Events - Part II' by Evelyn Evelyn. Without being able to verify which song is actually being recommended, and given that 'Tragic Events - Part II' is a theatrical/narrative piece by a dark cabaret duo (very different from intimate South American acoustic instrumentals), I cannot confidently map this to an emotional sub-vibe. The context suggests something like 'Chill - Ambient' or 'Chill - Evening' for intimate acoustic pieces, but the validated track title suggests 'Dark - Gothic' or 'Sad - Melancholic'. This discrepancy makes accurate emotional mapping impossible.",

It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think!
