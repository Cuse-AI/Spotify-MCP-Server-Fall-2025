      "ananki_reasoning": "There is a clear mismatch between the song described in the comment and the validated Spotify track. The human recommended The Go-Go's 'Head Over Heels' (described as 'fast, fun, great bass, slamming drums, great harmonies') which would clearly be 'Happy - Feel Good'. However, the validated Spotify track is Frank Ocean's 'Pyramids' - a 9+ minute experimental R&B epic that is moody, atmospheric, and introspective, bearing no resemblance to the upbeat 80s new wave song described. Without knowing which track is correct, I cannot accurately map the emotional intent.",
