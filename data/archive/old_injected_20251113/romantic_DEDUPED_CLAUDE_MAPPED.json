It's commonly listened to during moments of quiet contemplation rather than as background music. The stripped-down acoustic arrangement and profound lyrical content make it ideal for late-night philosophical thinking rather than other potential categories like Chill - Quiet Reflection (which would be more passive) or Happy - Optimistic (though hopeful, it's more serious and contemplative than uplifting).",

It was while I was working at this super conservative law firm that I first heard 'Crazy' by Gnarls Barkley. It felt like one of those movie moments where suddenly, the whole room lights up with color, life, and emotion. I didn’t dance out of the job or anything that day, but that song opened something inside me that helped me cope until I could finally move on. Another song that had a similar effect on me like that was 'Breakout' by Swing Out Sister.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The human explicitly describes both 'Crazy' by Gnarls Barkley and 'Breakout' by Swing Out Sister as songs that created a transformative moment - 'the whole room lights up with color, life, and emotion.' The key phrase 'opened something inside me that helped me cope until I could finally move on' indicates these songs represented liberation and transition from a restrictive environment (conservative law firm). 'Breakout' specifically carries themes of breaking free and starting fresh, and the human's context frames it as a catalyst for positive change and eventual life transition. This is quintessentially about new beginnings rather than just feeling good or being carefree - it's about transformation and finding the energy to move toward something better.",

The song list includes multiple romantic ballads and slow songs suitable for intimate moments. While 'Sister Golden Hair' has a bittersweet quality about romantic hesitation ('I ain't ready for the altar'), it's fundamentally a soft rock love ballad from 1975 that was commonly played at slow dances and romantic moments. The thread's focus on ballads like 'Really Love to See You Tonight,' 'Slow Dancing,' and 'The Way We Were' reinforces the slow dance, romantic atmosphere these songs evoke.",

This coincided with my own walking away from \"faith.\"  One of his best songs is [Priests & Paramedics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tbNEt67M3o) where a man gets stabbed by his wife and is in shock asking the paramedics assisting him if he is about to die.  I had a male friend who accepted he was an atheist after hearing that song.

This represents deep questioning of faith and spiritual uncertainty, which aligns with introspective questioning rather than pure darkness or sadness. The contemplative nature of religious doubt—wrestling with belief systems and existential questions—fits the introspective questioning category. While it has dark elements (cynicism), the core emotional context is about questioning and doubting rather than anxiety, brooding, or existential dread.",

The playful tone of the comment (including the humorous note about 'Surf n' Turf' being about farting) reinforces that the focus is on fun, head-bopping entertainment rather than serious intensity or workout energy.",

While 'Cornflake Girl' by Tori Amos wasn't explicitly listed in their comment (they mentioned 'Girl' instead), the context of the request strongly suggests dark, feminine, atmospheric energy. Tori Amos's work, especially from this era, has a distinctive mystical, powerful feminine energy that aligns with 'Dark - Witchy' - combining darkness with sensuality and an otherworldly quality. 'Dark - Noir' was also considered, but 'Witchy' better captures the feminine mystique and ethereal darkness that characterizes both the recommendation list and Tori Amos's aesthetic.",

The commenter describes wanting 'Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go' (an upbeat Wham! song) played at their funeral as a humorous, lighthearted choice that would annoy their wife - this is clearly meant as a joke/silly gesture. However, the Spotify track 'Anotha One Dead and Gone' by Do Or Die is a somber hip-hop track about loss and death. Given the human's expressed emotional intent (pranking their family with an inappropriately cheerful funeral song), the emotional context is clearly 'Happy - Silly' - they're making a humorous, irreverent choice about their own mortality. The actual Spotify track doesn't match this intent, but we're mapping based on the human's expressed emotional context, which is playful and comedic.",

The song's message about acceptance and frustration with life's limitations, combined with the dramatic musical escalation described, creates a release of pent-up emotion. While the lyrics are philosophical, the musical moment being highlighted is specifically about that explosive, amplified intensity that provides an emotional catharsis - not quite rage, but a powerful release of frustration and acceptance.",

I can still appreciate art from bad people, but I try to avoid supporting those people.\n\nIf I believe an artist is a bad person, I'm probably not going to attend their concert or buy their music - they directly profit from those actions.  I'm also probably not going to wear their merch - that associates me with them in a way that implies I condone their behavior.\n\nBut if I own an old CD of theirs from when I was a kid and I still love it, I'm probably not going to suddenly stop loving it.\n\nThere are exceptions in specifics.  When the Bill Cosby allegations came out, it did defeat my ability to enjoy his comedy.  But that's because the nature of his allegations directly conflicted with the art itself - he was supposed to be a wholesome family man, and it was impossible to keep thinking of him that way, so the jokes became uncomfortable rather than funny to me.\n\nSo I stopped watching my old Cosby VHS tapes.  But even then, it was because I stopped enjoying them.\n\nMichael Jackson's music is still awesome, and he cannot profit by my enjoying his music.  I still enjoy it.\n\nKanye's music is still awesome, but he CAN profit from my enjoyment.  I'll still privately listen to my College Dropout CD, but I'm probably not going to buy into anything he releases in modern times, and you won't find me in a Kanye shirt.\n\nSo there's a lot of variables.  \n\nJust my two cents.",

      "comment_text": "Sorry in advance for the length of this. Jump to the third paragraph below for specific suggestions based on  bands you listed (e.g., Of Monsters and Men, Arctic Monkeys):\n\nI had this problem too. The way I overcame it was to pay attention to what was drawing me in the songs I did like and give that quality a name. This helped me recognize it in a more conscious way so that it could become something I could listen for. Once I did this, it became much easier for me to detect this quality when I scanned through new music.\n\nHere's an example: [Nimble](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/72IFsjh0fDGX39uLocWyWr?si=d59b94e6f42a4313). This is a sprightly, light-footed quality in music. In terms of timbre and rhythm, it is like a fairy--fast, light, fluttery, delicate. For some reason this is a quality I'm drawn to in music, but it doesn't already exist as a genre, so I had to discover it for myself. I did this by adding any song that gave me this feeling to a playlist. It started with 1 song (the first in the playlist), and has now built up to 27. Over time, the essential quality uniting these songs became more apparent, and I came to realize \"this is something I really like.\" I'm really good at spotting it now when listening to new music, and its led me into genres I didn't used to listen to, like hyper-pop.\n\nSo going off of what you said above, you're already doing something like that with Of Monsters and Men. You gave it the name \"whimsical folk-ish.\" I'm guessing there's a quality you recognize in their music, that you are giving that name to. I might create a playlist like that: \"Whimsical Folkish.\" Can you think of an image that captures this same quality? Make that the cover image--the cover will help you sustain focus on the quality. I actually look at my playlist covers when I listen to them because they help me recognize the quality each playlist is built around.\n\nThen write a blurb that captures whatever it is that draws you to this whimsical folkish type sound. Like the picture, this helps you sustain focus on this quality. In a sense, this \"genre\" of music doesn't fully exist yet--it's in a kind of fledgling state, so anything that helps you sustain focus on this nebulous quality is good.\n\nThen I would go to [Discover Quickly](https://discoverquickly.com/) and start exploring. Here's one strategy: type \"Of Monsters and Men\" into the search bar. Click on their name and once you get to their page on the site, click \"recommended songs based on Of Monsters and Men.\" This will give you a bunch of songs to explore. Mouse over them to listen to snippets of each song. See if anything in the 30-second snippet gives you that \"whimsical folkish\" feeling. If so, add it to the playlist for deeper listening later.\n\nYou could do something similar with the Arctic Monkeys song. What is it you like about that song in particular? Can you recognize the quality you're responding to? Give it a name and build a playlist for it with just that one song in it. Then go to Discover Quickly, search for that song and when you find it, click \"recommended songs based on this.\" Start scanning through them, adding any song that gives you a similar feeling to the playlist. If none of the songs offered give you that feeling, click the refresh button (curved arrow above top row of songs offered) to get more.\n\nYou're building out from what you already like, further differentiating it and using it as a bridge into new music . This helped me expand my taste from indie-rock into pop, country, hip-hop and r&b. If you look at my [playlist library](https://open.spotify.com/user/apeiron101?si=ac4fe90ff27946d2), all but the first and last one are build around a specific quality in the way I'm describing. Through doing this, my musical taste has expanded dramatically in a few years. A lot of the qualities that you discover you respond to will cross existing genres and serve as gateways for you into these new musical worlds.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The Paper Kites' 'Willow Tree March' is being recommended in a context about discovering new music and paying attention to what draws you into songs.

The track exemplifies a gentle, soothing quality that someone might discover when consciously listening for what appeals to them in indie folk music. Given the song's soft acoustic nature, warm harmonies, and peaceful atmosphere, 'Chill - Gentle' best captures its emotional essence - it's calming without being meditative, pleasant without being overtly happy, and accessible as a discovery piece for someone exploring new indie/folk sounds.",

The song title suggests forward momentum and intentionality. Given OsamaSon's style of aggressive, energetic trap music with confident delivery, and the context of helping someone explore new music (suggesting bold, assertive tracks that make an impression), this fits the confident, self-assured energy category. The track represents the modern trap sound characterized by braggadocious flows and bold production that conveys self-assurance.",

The song itself features slow, heavy beats, distorted vocals, and a sense of urban darkness that aligns with brooding introspection rather than outright anxiety or depression. The playlist context of 'rising and falling, flowing in arcs' suggests emotional depth and contemplative darkness rather than high-energy or purely sad vibes.

The commenter praises Metric for Emily Haines's 'sharp lyrics' and the band's ability to evolve while maintaining their essential character - suggesting intellectually engaging, thoughtful music. The term 'artificial' combined with 'nocturne' implies a synthetic, contemplative nighttime atmosphere.

The song has a playful, humorous narrative quality with an upbeat tempo and lighthearted delivery despite the violent story content. It was recommended in a context specifically highlighting songs that avoid romantic themes, focusing instead on character-driven narrative storytelling. The song's tone is entertaining and somewhat comedic in its depiction of street-tough bravado meeting its match, fitting best with a fun, story-driven vibe rather than anything aggressive, dark, or reflective.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The commenter expresses love for this Siouxsie and the Banshees song, describing it as highly repeatable ('could listen to this song a million times in a row'), suggesting an infectious, easy-listening quality. 'Kiss Them For Me' is indeed one of the band's most accessible, dreamy pop songs with tropical percussion and a languid, summery atmosphere - it was intentionally crafted with a breezy, exotic feel. The song evokes beach imagery and warm, lazy vibes despite being by a post-punk/gothic rock band. The commenter's main complaint is about a funky breakdown disrupting this otherwise smooth, enjoyable experience, reinforcing that the core song delivers a laid-back, pleasant mood that aligns with beach/summer chill rather than the band's typical dark gothic sound.",

'Walking To New Orleans' by Fats Domino is a classic 1960s tune that evokes warm memories of early life experiences and parental influence. The context is about a formative childhood memory rather than sadness per se, but the nostalgic reflection on 'my dad loved that song' captures that bittersweet feeling of looking back at early memories with a parent.",

She uses her voice very expressively to evoke longing. Another in that direction is [Without You](https://youtu.be/llRW86iUmi0?list=OLAK5uy_kasxGTq7NGoxiNyPC-f4uOPjJLUffaFPw) where you can just feel the rejection and emptiness she sings of. Again goosebumps. My favorite song by her is a very dreamy ballad in German called [Ladonia](https://youtu.be/1ZD_L6MXIXY?list=OLAK5uy_kCchlyv2-4yPsRTbNaimg_eGKWxtZzmyo). It is again romantic longing for someone she can only dream about being with... the song ends on an exhale that really gets to me.",

The Reddit post is seeking emotionally intense female vocalists who 'pour emotion out' like Paramore's 'All I Wanted,' and the commenter recommends Bel Canto with singer Anneli Drecker who 'uses her voice very expressively to evoke longing.' However, the Spotify-validated song is 'When I Hear the Music of the Orchestra' by The Wiggles - a children's entertainment group. The Wiggles create educational content for young children, which is completely disconnected from the emotional, intense female vocal performance context described. This appears to be a data validation error or mismatch between the recommendation context and the actual song being classified.",

From Millennium onward, they had a good amount of bangers, even into that period in the later half of the 2000s when they tried to be more mature.\n\nAs for your other non-Kanye points...\n\nJohn Lennon may have been a terrible husband and father, but there's some good stuff there. Imagine may be cheesy af, but I can see why people like it.\n\nGary Glitter, though...

It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think!

Has the most hits and is very diverse.\n\nPrince\n- I started to listen to Prince about a year ago and now know a lot of his music. He has helped me embrace who I am and has such a unique sound\n- Purple Rain, Sign o The Times is close\n- Again I would recommend Purple Rain. The title track is imo the greatest song of all time every song is a hit. \n\nMetallica\n- Bit of a weird one according to my top 2 but I love them. Started listening to them about a year and a half ish years ago. They were introduction into harsh rock and metal. I love their guitar and got me into playing guitar myself.\n- …and Justice for All is my fav\n- If you are looking for something faster, more thrash, high screaming vocals I’d recommend ride the lightning or master of puppets. If you want heavier, slower or melodic and heavier/deeper vocals then the black album without a doubt\n\nThese are the only artists and bands I adore or just really know a lot about so just three ig 😂",

The Reddit context discusses the user's love for Michael Jackson and Prince, mentioning their foundational influence and self-discovery through music. However, the validated song is by Rascal Flatts (a country group) and is specifically labeled as 'Commentary,' which suggests it's a behind-the-scenes discussion rather than a musical piece with emotional resonance. There's a significant disconnect between the context (pop/R&B legends) and the actual track (country commentary), and commentary tracks don't typically map to emotional sub-vibes meant for music listening experiences.",

Car Seat Headrest (indie rock, slacker rock)\n\nFavorite album (and my favorite album of all time): How To Leave Town, I just think it's their most ambitious and relatable project\n\nRecommended album: Twin Fantasy (Face to Face), most CSH fans who got into the band after 2018 started with this album, most people consider it their magnum opus, the songwriting is extremely personal and heartbreaking at times (especially on the last 3 songs), if someone wants to check out 1 song I recommend Beach Life-In-Death, it's just iconic\n\n2. Swans (post-rock, experimental rock)\n\nFavorite album: To Be Kind, it's their most consistent album front to back, every song is an experience on its own and together they make something unforgettable, whether you like this album or not, I doubt it'll leave you indifferent\n\nRecommended album: White Light from the Mouth of Infinity, it's one of their most accessible works but still one of their strongest, I think Blind is one of the most beautifully written songs in their discography so I would start with that song\n\n3. Weatherday (noise pop, emo)\n\nFavorite album: both of them, Hornet Disaster and Come In are equally fantastic, great riffs, passionate performances, interesting songwriting and it's all noisy and I love when music is noisy\n\nRecommended album: Come In, purely because it's the first one and it's shorter, My Sputnik Sweetheart is a song I'd recommend from this album, it's a 12 minute emotional rollecoaster and it basically has everything Weatherday offers\n\n4. AJJ (folk punk, indie rock)\n\nFavorite album: Knife Man, it's a little messy but it's filled with fun and memorable songs that will make you laugh at how fucked we are, plus Big Bird is such a beautiful song, it's very different from their other songs but it's a perfect closer for an album like Knife Man\n\nRecommended album: People Who Eat People Are The Luckiest People In The World, this album is the perfect representation of AJJ's sound, it's probably their most cohesive record and has their best songwriting",

The comment is a negative, dismissive response criticizing an entire genre (Punjabi/Haryanvi music) and making assumptions about someone's cultural background. The Spotify track data appears to be satirical/fake ('Big Farts in the Poop Poop Room Fart Orchestra' with a song called 'Annoying You with This Annoying Song'). This seems to be either a joke entry, a data error, or someone being deliberately provocative rather than a genuine recommendation with emotional context about how music makes them feel. There is no authentic emotional sub-vibe being expressed here - just cultural dismissiveness and what appears to be troll content.",

The human's comment discusses discovering indie/alternative rock and new wave songs from soundtracks (The Church, Echo & the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears, The Shins, The Dead Texan, Damien Jurado - all atmospheric, introspective artists), but the validated Spotify song is 'Head Banger' by EPMD, which is a classic hip-hop track. This appears to be either a data error or the wrong song was matched to this context. Since the song doesn't align with the emotional context provided (soundtrack discovery of moody alternative tracks), I cannot accurately assign a sub-vibe.",
