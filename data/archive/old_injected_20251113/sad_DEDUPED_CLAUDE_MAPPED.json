While often cryptic and musically avant garde (essentially spoken word over minimalist/experimental guitar and synth) I think it fits the bill of what you're looking for. \n\nE.g., their song about killing an insect that landed in your drink:\n\n> some kind of water insect flew into the room  \n> some kind of water-based insect swam into the room  \n> it's drifted away now though  \n> right out into the middle hours of the day  \n> but to see that winged Goliath ripple the coffee in the jugs  \n> i never thought such fragile insects would cause so much bad luck  \n> some kind of heaving heart beats in the milk  \n> some kind-hearted spoon to scoop it up and dry  \n> it's leg bleats and panic signals were loud and clear  \n> legs work in pulses by the saucer side  \n> but the trove spill over  \n> ripples wash away the thing  \n> it bursts in bubbles of soap and grease and is buried wetly down the plug  \n> tiny creature such bad luck.\n\n[The Shadow Ring - Tiny Creatures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0LUiliLTWA)",

The example given (The Shadow Ring's cryptic, minimalist spoken word about killing an insect) suggests a contemplative, meditative quality that finds profundity in ordinary moments. This type of introspective observation of the mundane, especially when it evokes simultaneous emotional responses, aligns most closely with contemplative listening - the kind of music that prompts late-night reflection and philosophical thought about everyday existence.",

Why'd she freak out?  \nI saw the bullet had got her right in the ear  \nI knew then the end was near  \nSo I ran down and I said, in her good ear  \n\"Debbie, why did you do it?\"  \nShe raised her head, smiled and said, \"I did it for Johnny\"\n\n  \nTori Amos is one of my favorite artists.

What's so amazing about **really deep thoughts**? Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon! How's that thought for you?\n\nRegina Spektor is also at masterfully turning a phrase.

      "ananki_reasoning": "While the Reddit post describes a darkly comedic, absurdist song by Julie Brown, the validated song is Regina Spektor's 'Samson' - a deeply melancholic ballad about biblical love and loss. The human's request for 'lyrics where you are torn between laughing, crying, and deep reflection' combined with 'everyday things' aligns with Spektor's style of poignant storytelling with bittersweet emotional complexity. 'Samson' evokes the specific quality of being emotionally moved by mundane details in the context of loss and memory - that liminal space between tears and contemplation. The melancholic sub-vibe captures this reflective sadness better than pure grief or heartbreak, as it encompasses the wistful, thought-provoking quality the human is seeking.",

Pop punk is known for taking mundane, everyday experiences and infusing them with emotional weight that feels both relatable and bittersweet.

While the first song mentioned ('Roslyn') has 'end of the world vibes,' the validated song is 'Never be Alright' by Seon (though Spotify shows artist as Aubrey Key), which is the one connected to their friend's death. The grief sub-vibe is most appropriate as it encompasses the deep, ongoing mourning and traumatic loss described.",

The phrase 'it fucking sucks' emphasizes the acute emotional pain of this imbalanced dynamic. While there are elements of loneliness, the core emotional context is the active heartbreak of being undervalued by a romantic partner, making 'Sad - Heartbreak' the most fitting sub-vibe.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The reference song 'merry christmas, please don't call' by Bleachers has a bittersweet, melancholic holiday theme about not wanting contact with someone during Christmas - suggesting heartbreak mixed with holiday nostalgia. The human is seeking songs with similar thematic and sonic elements. Winter Wonderland by The Courteeners, in this context, is being recommended as part of a collection that captures that specific emotional blend of Christmas/winter settings with underlying sadness or longing. The nostalgic sad sub-vibe best captures this intersection of holiday imagery with melancholic feelings, particularly given the UK indie rock treatment The Courteeners would give to a classic Christmas standard, likely imbuing it with a wistful or bittersweet quality that matches the original request.",

The contemplative nature of processing these tragic events, the weight of systemic oppression, and the deep reflection required to unpack the layered meaning makes this fit the contemplative sub-vibe.

The context makes clear this is about deeply depressing, not just melancholic or heartbreak-focused music. The user is specifically curating a collection of the most emotionally heavy country songs, suggesting 'Secretariat' by Jeffrey Foucault fits this intensely depressive emotional space rather than lighter sad sub-categories.",

The song fits within a list that includes Johnny Cash's 'Hurt' and songs about heartbreak and pain. The context clearly indicates someone seeking music for a depressive state, and this song's underlying themes of despair and disillusionment align with that emotional need.",

This nostalgic reflection on past seasonal memories, rather than acute sadness or current depression, best fits the 'Nostalgic Sad' sub-vibe - looking back at times past with bittersweet emotion during the cold, introspective winter season.",

Nine Inch Nails' 90s output (Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, The Downward Spiral) was known for its dark, intense, industrial sound. Godflesh is a pioneering industrial metal band known for extremely heavy, mechanical, and nihilistic soundscapes. The 'Pure' album in particular is renowned for its crushing, dystopian atmosphere.

So...\n\nTool - Wings For Marie / 10,000 Days (back to back is the only way to listen to these)\n\nAs with many of Maynard's songs, this tackles his mother's unwavering piousness in the face of her disability, and his cynicism towards it. It's climax is unrelenting. I was also tempted to recommend The Noose by A Perfect Circle (another of his bands) which deals with similar themes.\n\nPorcupine Tree - Anesthetize\n\nSlow building and dark, this song captures individual loneliness and mental struggle in the midst of a fractured, cathode-drowned society. If you like it, I'd recommend Russia on Ice for it's slow build, or shesmoviedon for it's perfect solo.\n\nManchester Orchestra - The Silence\n\nSlow building and powerful - an introspective look at escaping the shackles of genetic inheritance. Andy Hull's vocals are, a bit like Jeff's, mesmerising and overwhelming in their beauty. Other songs I'd recommend are Rear View and Dinosaur.\n\nJosh Ritter - Dreams\n\nBit more folky than the rest, this one looks at depression. His lyrical prowess is on display here - the imagery is incredible. He hasn't really done any others like it.\n\nThe Decemberists - The Island...\n\nOne of those breaking the mould prog tracks from a classically folk outfit - this is a retelling of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Joan in the Garden is their other similar track.\n\nTyphoon - Ariadne\n\nThe closer on a brilliant album about spiralling dementia - dark, brooding and wonderfully orchestral. If you like it... the whole album is a journey to it I'd recommend taking. And their other albums (although less brooding). I could wax lyrical all day tbh.\n\nHope you like these!",

The word 'gothic' is directly stated, and the recommendation context emphasizes building intensity, emotional weight, and climactic unrelenting moments. Manchester Orchestra's 'The Silence' fits this aesthetic perfectly - it's a slow-building, emotionally devastating track known for its atmospheric build and cathartic climax. The reference songs (Weezer's 'Only in Dreams', Jeff Buckley's 'Forget Her', Brand New's 'Limousine') and the Tool recommendation all share this dark, building, emotionally heavy quality that aligns with the Gothic sub-vibe.",

      "comment_text": "Well i'm a music person..\n\nSaying you listened to 200 albums doesnt really matter cause this is not a numbers game as in listening to as much music as possible. Just listening to a song once doesn't do much for most people.\n\nMost music is about tantric repetition. You can get into a very calm state of mind by listening to the same rytm for over 5 minutes. Listening to the same song repeatedly is also very statifying for your brain as it gets more and more comfortable being able to predict whats comming and getting into the rytm.\n\nThe emotional response is not something you are born with but its trained. Most of this has to happen on a very early age or around 10-14 years old for you to become a music person.\n\nUsually people link certain music to things they have experienced at the time they where listening to that type of music a lot. Or they link certain sounds to certain emotions. Many instruments mimic speach in some way while the rytm is the heartbeat and breathing tempo.\n\nI'm not a professor or anything just a musician and facinated by music.. so i'm sorry if this explanation is a bit to floaty 😅",

The emphasis on calm, repetition, and extended listening sessions (5+ minutes of the same rhythm) points to an ambient chill sub-vibe rather than active energy or emotional intensity.",

It's climax is unrelenting. I was also tempted to recommend The Noose by A Perfect Circle (another of his bands) which deals with similar themes.\n\nPorcupine Tree - Anesthetize\n\nSlow building and dark, this song captures individual loneliness and mental struggle in the midst of a fractured, cathode-drowned society. If you like it, I'd recommend Russia on Ice for it's slow build, or shesmoviedon for it's perfect solo.\n\nManchester Orchestra - The Silence\n\nSlow building and powerful - an introspective look at escaping the shackles of genetic inheritance. Andy Hull's vocals are, a bit like Jeff's, mesmerising and overwhelming in their beauty. Other songs I'd recommend are Rear View and Dinosaur.\n\nJosh Ritter - Dreams\n\nBit more folky than the rest, this one looks at depression. His lyrical prowess is on display here - the imagery is incredible. He hasn't really done any others like it.\n\nThe Decemberists - The Island...\n\nOne of those breaking the mould prog tracks from a classically folk outfit - this is a retelling of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Joan in the Garden is their other similar track.\n\nTyphoon - Ariadne\n\nThe closer on a brilliant album about spiralling dementia - dark, brooding and wonderfully orchestral.

However, the Spotify-validated song is 'The Decline' by NOFX, which is an 18-minute punk rock epic about societal collapse and political commentary - not about personal grief or ocean themes. This appears to be a validation error where the wrong song was matched to the recommendation context.",
