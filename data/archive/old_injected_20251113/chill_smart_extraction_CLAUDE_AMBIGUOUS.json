They don't deserve the hate they get cause they're just nice dudes who made it. \n\nKirk Hammett is basically the 16 year old guitar metal nerd you new from high school. Still absolutely in love with music and talking music.\n\nDaryl Hall is INSANELY talented and knows it. Absolutely insufferable.\n\nNever met John Oats but I suspect he's the nice one from the duo…\n\n\n\nNot musicians but other celebrities (I've met a ton cause of my business partner).\n\nWWE guys are all fucking nuts but super cool dudes with great stories. \n\nShamus and Cesaro are the nicest fucking guys. \n\nCesaro is just the most down to earth dude.  Shamus asked us to look at his audition tape for The Walking Dead. He was going on and get my feedback. \n\nSTING is super nice and very religious. Prays before each meal. It was like hanging out with your friends dad but then random people come up to him and are like \"Are you STINGER?\" \n\nWWE superstars have to buy all their own wardrobe shit so we're walking through a mall in Texas talking business and STINGER stops in front of a womans clothing store. They had this gothic looking robe in the window. He comes out a bit later looking disappointed he says \"They didn't have it XXXL\"\n\nRyan Reynolds is a dick who pretends to be nice… \n\nAntonio Brown is batshit crazy but has charisma in spades. Dude moves like a human panther. It's crazy how agile he is in real life. Hanging with him is like viewing life on another planet… We were talking and he's getting snaps sent to him by A list celebrity women.

That's why I want to be upfront about the process and how I use it:\n\n* My lyrics are purely mine. My thoughts, my stories, and my personal experiences are the absolute starting point. I also compose all melodies on the piano first.\n* I use AI not as a ghostwriter, but as a powerful tool for rapid experimentation and sound design. Using tools like Suno Studio for rapid stem manipulation, I can instantly audition my core piano melody across dozens of instrumentations and genres. This allows me to explore and commit to a final arrangement much faster than I could using traditional software, without having to manually score or re-record every part. I guide and direct every step.\n* After the AI helps me explore and choose the best direction, I spend extensive time editing, mixing, and fine-tuning to ensure the track retains the emotional weight and personal touch of the original melody.\n\nMy goal is to take something fundamentally human and amplify its impact through technology, creating tracks that are personal, immersive, but uniquely a product of my own direction - I'm hoping that stands out with my songs. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on this process (and I promise the word \"neon\" will never show up in any of my music).\n\nAlso, any feedback on the above track from my Soundcloud would always be appreciated!",

It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think!

      "ananki_reasoning": "There is a significant mismatch between the context and the validated song. The human's post describes seeking 'relaxed, upbeat, melancholy very 2010s songs' similar to Norah Jones' 'Chasing Pirates' and provides recommendations like Zero 7, Tennis, and Flunk - all mellow, downtempo, indie/electronic artists. However, the validated Spotify song is 'Free Meal' by Hopsin, who is a hardcore/horrorcore hip-hop artist known for aggressive, confrontational rap music. This song does not match the emotional profile described (relaxed, melancholic, upbeat indie/electronic) at all. This appears to be either a data validation error or the wrong song was mapped to this recommendation context.",
