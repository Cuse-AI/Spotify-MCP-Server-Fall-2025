The human recommended 'Shooting for the Stars' by SB19 for a 'stargazing when you're tired but want the vibes' context (which would suggest Chill - Evening or Night - Contemplative), but Spotify validated the track as 'Hit 'Em Up' by 2Pac - an aggressive diss track that does not match the peaceful stargazing context at all. This appears to be a technical error in song validation rather than the human's actual recommendation.",

The human's intent was to recommend an electronic/ambient track for the 'floating in space' feeling, but the Spotify validation shows a completely different song - likely due to a link error or misidentification. Without being able to verify the actual song being recommended, I cannot accurately map it to an emotional sub-vibe.",
