      "ananki_reasoning": "The comment appears to be about post-apocalyptic ideological conflict rather than the emotional experience of listening to this specific song. Eric Church's 'Springsteen' is actually a nostalgic country ballad about young love and memories associated with Bruce Springsteen's music - it has nothing to do with apocalyptic themes. The comment seems either mismatched with the song or is referencing something unrelated to the actual musical content and emotional experience of 'Springsteen.' Without understanding how this apocalyptic commentary relates to the nostalgic love song, I cannot confidently map this to an appropriate emotional sub-vibe.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The comment text appears to be thanking someone for releasing free music and comparing them to Kevin MacLeod, but this seems to be a generic comment about a music channel/creator rather than expressing an emotional response to the specific R.A.P. Ferreira song 'AN IDEA IS A WORK OF ART'. The post title mentions '(Post-)Apocalyptic Music' which could suggest a dark or contemplative mood, but the comment itself doesn't provide any emotional context about how this particular song makes the listener feel or what emotional experience it provides. The disconnect between the comment content (praising free music distribution) and the validated song (a R.A.P. Ferreira track) suggests this may be mismatched data or the comment was intended for a different context.",
