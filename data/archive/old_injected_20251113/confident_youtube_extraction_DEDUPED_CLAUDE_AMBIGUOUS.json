The quote is humorous dialogue about a runaway train, but without knowing which scene this song appears in or what emotional role it plays in the film, I cannot determine the appropriate sub-vibe. The comment focuses on the movie's plot rather than the musical or emotional qualities of the song.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The comment 'Is anyone just randomly watching the old songs?' is too vague and doesn't provide emotional context. While it appears in a thread titled 'Self Love Songs' and the song 'Black Widow' is about empowerment/revenge rather than self-love, the comment itself only asks about nostalgic viewing habits without expressing any specific emotional state or connection to the music. The disconnect between the thread topic (self love), the song's actual theme (revenge/empowerment), and the generic nature of the comment makes it impossible to confidently map to a specific sub-vibe.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "There is a significant mismatch between the context and the validated song. The comment references 'Ashanti sounds so good here' in a thread about 'Self Love Songs,' suggesting an R&B/soul track by the artist Ashanti. However, the Spotify-validated song is 'Sam Visits' by Nathan Barr, who is a film/TV composer known for instrumental scores (particularly for shows like True Blood). This appears to be either a metadata error or the wrong song was validated. Without being able to confirm the actual song being discussed, I cannot accurately map it to an emotional sub-vibe.",
