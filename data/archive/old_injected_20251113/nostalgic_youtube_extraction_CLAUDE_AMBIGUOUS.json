There is no emotional context about the song itself, no description of how the music makes them feel, and no clear connection between the comment and the musical/emotional qualities of 'A Song Of Ascents (Starlight Melody II).' The comment reads as general praise for content creation rather than a music recommendation with emotional intent.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The comment appears to be discussing a completely different context than the Spotify-validated song. The human is commenting about 'TV British Shows - The Good Old Days' and praising 'Lorne Lesley' for having 'a voice' that could 'project' - this seems to reference vintage British television variety shows or theatrical performances. However, the validated song is 'Caramel' by Sleep Token, a modern progressive metal/alternative band. Sleep Token's 'Caramel' is a contemporary atmospheric track that has no connection to vintage British TV shows or the performer 'Lorne Lesley.' This appears to be a mismatched validation where the comment context does not relate to the actual song identified by Spotify.",

Leonard, as always, is charm and chivalry personified in his attentions towards the principal lady singer. The multi-talented Edward Woodward rouses the always-willing audience. The show continues to delight half a century on.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The comment discusses a British TV variety show from the past, specifically praising the King's Singers' performance and Edward Woodward's presence. However, the validated Spotify song is 'Summer Long' by DRIEL, which appears to be a modern artist completely unrelated to the King's Singers, British variety shows, or the nostalgic TV content being discussed. There is a complete disconnect between the context (which is about a vintage TV performance) and the actual song provided. Without any clear emotional expression about the song 'Summer Long' itself, I cannot accurately map this to a sub-vibe.",
