      "ananki_reasoning": "There is a clear mismatch between the context and the validated song. The post title indicates 'Energy Booster: Rock' and the comment mentions Papa Roach (a rock band), which would typically map to an Energy sub-vibe like 'Energy - Pump Up' or 'Energy - Powerful'. However, the Spotify-validated song is 'Photographic Memories' by Boldy James featuring Earl Sweatshirt, which is a hip-hop track with a completely different sonic and emotional profile than Papa Roach. This suggests either a validation error or the wrong song was linked. Without being able to trust the relationship between the human's emotional context and the actual song, I cannot confidently assign a sub-vibe.",
