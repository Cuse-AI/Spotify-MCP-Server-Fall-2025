That's why I want to be upfront about the process and how I use it:\n\n* My lyrics are purely mine. My thoughts, my stories, and my personal experiences are the absolute starting point. I also compose all melodies on the piano first.\n* I use AI not as a ghostwriter, but as a powerful tool for rapid experimentation and sound design. Using tools like Suno Studio for rapid stem manipulation, I can instantly audition my core piano melody across dozens of instrumentations and genres. This allows me to explore and commit to a final arrangement much faster than I could using traditional software, without having to manually score or re-record every part. I guide and direct every step.\n* After the AI helps me explore and choose the best direction, I spend extensive time editing, mixing, and fine-tuning to ensure the track retains the emotional weight and personal touch of the original melody.\n\nMy goal is to take something fundamentally human and amplify its impact through technology, creating tracks that are personal, immersive, but uniquely a product of my own direction - I'm hoping that stands out with my songs. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on this process (and I promise the word \"neon\" will never show up in any of my music).\n\nAlso, any feedback on the above track from my Soundcloud would always be appreciated!",

It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think! Thanks so much! Here's the link to the song on Spotify but it's on Apple Music, Deezer and almost all platforms too:\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/3porKsR3WhmOfJInQYXeK5](https://open.spotify.com/track/3porKsR3WhmOfJInQYXeK5)\n\n\n\nAnd my second song is already up exclusively to SoundCloud right now but going onto the other streaming services in like 15 days, here's the link:\n\n\n\n[https://soundcloud.com/kasprikkk/detached-stars-kasprikkk](https://soundcloud.com/kasprikkk/detached-stars-kasprikkk)",
