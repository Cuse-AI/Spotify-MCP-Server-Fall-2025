This is a clear healing narrative - moving from a dark emotional place to one of self-acceptance and personal growth. While there are introspective elements, the emphasis is on the positive transformation and the healing process rather than the contemplation itself. The song 'Yellow' serves as an anthem for their self-love journey, making 'Happy - Healing' the most appropriate sub-vibe.",

This framing indicates the song deals with ending a relationship in a gentle, self-reflective way where the speaker takes responsibility. Hozier's 'Too Sweet' is indeed about incompatibility in a relationship where the narrator recognizes they're not the right fit for their partner. While there are introspective elements, the core emotional context is about the heartbreak and sadness of a relationship ending, even when done thoughtfully. The 'beautiful' descriptor suggests emotional poignancy rather than anger or bitterness.",
