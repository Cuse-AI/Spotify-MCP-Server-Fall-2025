      "ananki_reasoning": "The comment '1:42 the part we all know and love' references a specific, beloved moment in Usher's 'My Boo' - a 2004 R&B duet with Alicia Keys that became iconic for millennials and Gen Z. The context of being in a 'Romantic Music - Cheesy Love Songs Playlist' combined with the nostalgic reference to a universally recognized part suggests this song evokes memories of young/teenage romance from the 2000s. 'My Boo' is specifically about reminiscing on a first love ('you will always be my boo'), making it nostalgic by nature. The communal 'we all know and love' indicates shared generational memory of teen years when this song was everywhere.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The commenter explicitly states 'I'm on the floor weepinggggg THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL' in response to Ariana Grande's 'pov' on a romantic playlist. The repeated 'g's in 'weepinggggg' emphasize the intensity of the emotional response. While the song appears on a romantic playlist and the emotion is positive ('SO BEAUTIFUL'), the primary emotional expression is crying/weeping, which indicates tears of overwhelming beauty rather than sadness. However, the 'Sad - Crying' sub-vibe best captures the literal weeping response, even if the tears are from being moved by romantic beauty rather than heartbreak. This is a common response to deeply touching romantic songs.",

The song is a quintessential slow dance number from the swing/big band era, known for its dreamy, romantic quality and its association with couples dancing together. The song's gentle swaying rhythm, romantic lyrics about longing and love across distance, and its timeless appeal make it a perfect fit for the slow dance category. This is exactly the type of song that would be played at weddings, anniversaries, or romantic moments where couples dance together.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The comment 'as a black male I can confirm this is a certified hood classic' appears to be an ironic or humorous statement, as it's posted on a 'Best Love Songs and Romantic Songs' playlist, yet the song 'Anubis' by CozB (named after an Egyptian deity) doesn't traditionally fit the 'hood classic' description. This seems to be either a meme-style comment, sarcasm, or contextually disconnected from the actual emotional vibe of the song. Without genuine emotional context about how the song makes the commenter feel or what emotional experience it provides, I cannot accurately map this to a specific sub-vibe. The comment reads more as internet humor than a sincere emotional expression about the music.",
