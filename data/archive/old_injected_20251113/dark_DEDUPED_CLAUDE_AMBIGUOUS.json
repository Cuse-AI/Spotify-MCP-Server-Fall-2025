However, the validated Spotify song is 'Gameboy' by KATSEYE, which is a K-pop/pop girl group track that does not align with extreme metal or disturbing music whatsoever.

The comment discusses a Simon D EP called 'Every Day Is Some Day' from Home Hearing Records (2025), but Spotify validated a completely different track: 'Heaven's EP' by Dreamville featuring J. Cole. These are different artists, different song titles, and likely different musical content. Without being able to hear the actual validated Dreamville/J. Cole track or having any emotional context about it specifically, I cannot accurately map it to a sub-vibe. The promotional text about Simon D's 'genre-blending' and 'exploratory yet accessible sound' does not apply to the validated song.",

It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think!

That's why I want to be upfront about the process and how I use it:\n\n* My lyrics are purely mine. My thoughts, my stories, and my personal experiences are the absolute starting point. I also compose all melodies on the piano first.\n* I use AI not as a ghostwriter, but as a powerful tool for rapid experimentation and sound design. Using tools like Suno Studio for rapid stem manipulation, I can instantly audition my core piano melody across dozens of instrumentations and genres. This allows me to explore and commit to a final arrangement much faster than I could using traditional software, without having to manually score or re-record every part. I guide and direct every step.\n* After the AI helps me explore and choose the best direction, I spend extensive time editing, mixing, and fine-tuning to ensure the track retains the emotional weight and personal touch of the original melody.\n\nMy goal is to take something fundamentally human and amplify its impact through technology, creating tracks that are personal, immersive, but uniquely a product of my own direction - I'm hoping that stands out with my songs. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on this process (and I promise the word \"neon\" will never show up in any of my music).\n\nAlso, any feedback on the above track from my Soundcloud would always be appreciated!",

I especially enjoy the [Pony Express Record](https://open.spotify.com/album/32ak1L0uXsWvZhsek6tWbn) Album, I think it is its most distinctive album, the one that makes me think: \"Yeah, this is a Shudder to Think song\".\n\nI also enjoy a jazz pianist and composer called Blumen, he's great, and it broke my heart to see how when I listened to this song, called Ossycles[Ossycles](https://open.spotify.com/track/46RTgFQilI962SigoaVsSa), it has around 6 likes or something... It is a wonderful song.\n\nAnyways. Hope you enjoy!",

      "ananki_reasoning": "There is a clear mismatch between the comment context and the validated song. The comment discusses indie/alternative rock band Shudder to Think and jazz pianist Blumen, with a focus on the 'Pony Express Record' album and appreciation for critically acclaimed but underappreciated artists. However, the validated Spotify track is 'No Hands' by Waka Flocka Flame - a mainstream hip-hop/trap club anthem from 2010. This song is completely unrelated to the musical discussion in the comment. The comment also appears to be cut off mid-sentence ('it broke my heart to s'). This suggests either a technical error in song validation, the comment was incomplete, or there's missing context that would explain the connection. Without a clear relationship between the emotional/musical context provided and the actual song, I cannot confidently assign a sub-vibe.",
