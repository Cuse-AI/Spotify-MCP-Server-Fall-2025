So what, life's tough
You should get over yourself
Like everyone else and enjoy

And everything in between

The things that annoy you
You hide- far, far away
And life just passes you by
Are you gonna give up
Are you gonna give",2,musicsuggestions,https://reddit.com/r/musicsuggestions/comments/1ob5omf/songs_about_low_self_esteemptsd/nkesx0c/,reddit,self assured songs,Confident/Powerful,Various
