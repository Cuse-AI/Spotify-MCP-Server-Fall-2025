It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think!

Being totally transparent, it is indicative of who I am, both being a perfectionist and an autistic person. For me, there is no balance between lacking momentum entirely and having an unhealthy obsession regarding any project. Much like many other autistics, I only ever over-commit (and for far too long, like with this song) — at least, as long as I can get over the executive dysfunction hump.\n\nOver four years, this song was abandoned countless times, almost always due to the result of burnout from the song itself, and pushing myself in other areas of life too far. The interesting thing is: from the start, this was intended to be a representation of the very push and pull I experience so frequently — lo and behold, the push and pull (or \"dichotomy process\") was ever present from start to finish of creating this track.\n\nI'm just happy I was able to overcome the perfectionism and get this out there.\n\n(Also, if anyone has any idea of which genre-specific communities I can share this with, that would be great — historically, people say almost everything I make isn't \"\\[insert genre here\\] enough\\],\" making it harder to share, especially as someone with an extreme anxiety when it comes to interacting with online communities for some reason.)",
