The combination of Dark Wave influences and synth-driven 80s sound creates an atmospheric, cruising quality that aligns perfectly with the nocturnal, reflective mood of a night drive—a common context for this era and style of music.

Looking at the context: the user is discussing their love for 80s synth, soft rock, and specifically mentions Spandau Ballet's 'True' and 'Gold'. However, the Spotify validation shows this is actually Concrete Blonde's 'True' (a different song from 1987, an alternative/new wave track with darker, more brooding tones). Given Concrete Blonde's atmospheric, introspective alternative rock style combined with the user's interest in Dark Wave and 80s music, and considering the moody, reflective nature of Concrete Blonde's work, this maps best to 'Night - Contemplative'. The song fits the nighttime, thoughtful emotional space that bridges the user's interest in darker wave music with introspective 80s alternative rock.",

      "ananki_reasoning": "The artist explicitly states the track is 'inspired lyrically by eternal sunshine of the spotless mind' - a film about erasing painful memories of lost love - which signals melancholic nostalgia. The sonic influences cited (Slowdive, Cocteau Twins) are quintessential dream-pop/shoegaze artists known for wistful, atmospheric soundscapes that evoke bittersweet longing. The genres listed (Dream-Pop, Alternative, Trip-Hop) combined with these references and the film's themes of memory and lost romance point to a sad, nostalgic emotional space rather than pure melancholy or heartbreak. The song appears to explore wistful reflection on past emotional experiences through a hazy, dreamy lens.",

While 'Diamonds And Rust' differs stylistically from most listed artists, it shares that quality of emotional depth and reflection. The song's acoustic folk sound combined with its lyrical content about memory, lost love, and the passage of time ('Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic / Then give me another word for it') makes it quintessentially nostalgic and melancholic—looking back at something beautiful that's gone with both appreciation and sorrow.",

The song title itself evokes violent imagery. While the user's list includes experimental indie (Still House Plants), post-punk (Autolux, Beak>), and art rock (Battles, Young Fathers), this particular track represents the heavier, more aggressive end of their musical exploration. The song's primary emotional characteristic is raw, unrelenting aggression with extreme metal intensity, making 'Energy - Aggressive' the most appropriate classification. Other considered options like 'Energy - Rage' or 'Energy - Cathartic Anger' could also apply, but 'Aggressive' best captures the song's overwhelming sonic assault and brutal delivery.",

However, the validated song is 'The Beach House' by South Park Mexican (SPM), a Houston rapper known for Chicano rap/hip-hop, not dark jazz or trip hop. SPM's music typically falls into Southern hip-hop/Latin rap categories. Without being able to verify the actual song content or understand why this particular track was recommended in this context, I cannot confidently assign a sub-vibe.

It took a while to get it on streaming platforms but finally it worked out! I'm super, super, SUPER happy!!! If anyone wants to listen and help me out, I'd really appreciate it for real, I'm really inspired by Aphex Twin, Bjork, Arca, Autechre, Burial, Boards Of Canada, Squarepusher, Eartheater, Sega Bodega, etc I hope my music evokes the same feelings as these artists music evokes in me 💛💛💛 There were some issues with distribution, so it was \"released\" for a month without any views because nobody could listen to it 💀 It's an ambient instrumental piece, really calm, but with different sounds, for example, the synth I used is actually my voice! I think people will like it because I made it with a lot of love as It was a Valentine's Day gift for the love of my life (yeah, I was waiting since before Valentine's Day 😭) If you listen to it, please give me your opinion and let me know what you think! Thanks so much!

The interesting thing is: from the start, this was intended to be a representation of the very push and pull I experience so frequently — lo and behold, the push and pull (or \"dichotomy process\") was ever present from start to finish of creating this track.\n\nI'm just happy I was able to overcome the perfectionism and get this out there.\n\n(Also, if anyone has any idea of which genre-specific communities I can share this with, that would be great — historically, people say almost everything I make isn't \"\\[insert genre here\\] enough\\],\" making it harder to share, especially as someone with an extreme anxiety when it comes to interacting with online communities for some reason.)",

The comment describes an indie pop track that the commenter personally released, influenced by Nick Cave, Brian Wilson, and Leonard Cohen. However, Spotify validated this as 'Nights Like This' by Kehlani feat. Ty Dolla $ign, which is a contemporary R&B/pop track - completely different from what was described. The YouTube link timestamp (t=880) suggests this may be from a playlist or compilation where the commenter's indie track appears, but the Spotify validation points to an entirely different commercial release. Without being able to verify which song is actually being recommended, I cannot accurately map the emotional sub-vibe.",

The human is discussing Death Note soundtrack music characterized by 'acoustic guitar with electronic beats and synth sounds' and recommends Nakaido Chabo Rei'ichi from Serial Experiments Lain - music with an experimental, atmospheric, possibly dark or brooding quality. However, the validated Spotify track is 'Machika - Remix' by J Balvin, which is a Latin reggaeton party track. This genre and emotional context are completely incompatible with the Death Note/Lain aesthetic described. Either there was an error in song validation, the link was incorrect, or the recommendation is unrelated to the stated musical preference. Without being able to trust the connection between the context and the actual song, I cannot accurately map this to a sub-vibe.",

'Tiny Dancer' is a warm, nostalgic, gentle song but doesn't match the 'haunting but calm' vibe the human was curating.
