Can we talk about how the word 'era' has kind of lost all meaning?,"Can we talk about how the word 'era' has kind of lost all meaning?

Not trying to be negative here, but I’ve been thinking lately about how every new release seems to get labelled as an 'era.' I get that it's shorthand for a distinct creative phase - a new sound / look / concept. But - somewhere along the way it feels like 'era' became a *requirement* rather than a description?!

Techno music that sounds like a chase,"Techno music that sounds like a chase

I found this fast paced techno music, that sounds like something you would play during a chase scene. The video is made by a brazilian group called technobalde. Another example would be [Night Hawk](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zkoiRGoxE20) from the Devilman OST. I also like Rave or Aircraft by Dxrk. Do you know what this music is called or can suggest similar tracks?

Hi All! I'm fairly new to gaming (at least to indie PC games) and I'd love some targeted recommendations based on my top 3 fave games from the past year.

In no particular order: Outer Wilds, Disco Elysuim, and Wytchwood.

I think I'm into 'choose your path' type open-world exploration games with a bit of crafting that have a darker element to them, but honestly I'm still not sure how these three games really connect.

Hi guys. I'd like it if you would give me some sad songs. However, I don't want those popular sad songs maybe give me something from smaller artist/underground ones because I want to hear new things and add things to my playlist :)

**Update**

Omg thank you all for giving me lots of songs to listen to! I've added alot of songs to my playlist! Thank you guys!!!",less than zero,The Weeknd,2,spotify,dash_format,https://reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1ohq0ih/sad_songs/,reddit,2

Techno music that sounds like a chase,"Techno music that sounds like a chase

I found this fast paced techno music, that sounds like something you would play during a chase scene. The video is made by a brazilian group called technobalde. Another example would be [Night Hawk](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zkoiRGoxE20) from the Devilman OST. I also like Rave or Aircraft by Dxrk. Do you know what this music is called or can suggest similar tracks?

Spooky songs for a Halloween party that aren’t “Halloween music”,"Spooky songs for a Halloween party that aren’t “Halloween music”

So I’m having a Halloween get together tonight and am looking to fill out the music playlist.   I already have the “classic” Halloween songs, but am looking for more music that has a spooky, Halloween vibe without necessarily being about Halloween.  I found a song by Darkness Falls (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cjuYcm_H6sA) that has the vibe I’m looking for.

I feel like my music taste has been stagnating, especially with algorithms getting worse and worse... I will list a few other artists/songs that I like to hopefully give a better picture of what type of music I listen to, but if you have something more out there I would absolutely be willing to give it a listen too. I also don't mind either classic/well known artists or hidden gems you'd like to champion!

My favorite bands/artists are Led Zeppelin, The Doors, The Beatles, Cream, Jimi Hendrix, The Clash and a ton of other dead guys.

I am trying to find modern rock bands that I will like. I got the tip Greta Van Fleet and really enjoying it so far but looking for more. I want to get to know bands I can actually go and see live.

I do like some ""modern"" (aka active) bands as well. Mando Diao, Oasis, Radiohead and so on. But I rea",MAID are the best currently active band,BAND,1,ifyoulikeblank,dash_format,https://reddit.com/r/ifyoulikeblank/comments/1o2zt1z/iil_classic_rock_who_should_i_listen_to_that_is/,reddit,1

[IIL] sullen industrial music,"[IIL] sullen industrial music

Trying to create a new sad playlist :). It doesn't necessarily have to be industrial, but just going for more of a heavy vibe. So far, I have ""All the Love in the World"" and ""The Day the World Went Away"" (NIN), ""Isn't Everyone"" (HEALTH), ""Spiders"" (System of a Down), ""Pioneer to the Falls"" (Interpol), ""Turn My Head (Live), ""Lonesome Tears"" (Beck)... I am open to any and all recommendations for additional music with this same vibe.

"[iil] Here are my favorite TV shows, what should I watch next?","[iil] Here are my favorite TV shows, what should I watch next?

Ranked: 
1. Hannibal✨️
2. Moral Orel
3. Twin Peaks
4. Game of Thrones

What should I watch next? Well written characters and not too cliché/ predictable plot lines are really important to me. Also looking for hidden gems because I've been looking for a while so I've probably already heard of a lot of the big titles 

Also just in case, Ive already seen Dark, loved it!

I love this song so much, but I have no idea of what the genre technically is or what sounds might be similar. I’m really in an era where I love vibey, kinda funky music. So anything that is a vibe! Another song I love is Satisfied by Family Company!

I'm honestly not sure how to describe the vibe and/or genre of these songs, but they both have a very nostalgic and calming vibe that I don't know what to search for to find similar songs. It's not necessarily nostalgic in the sense of memory either as I'm only 21 and these songs existed way before I was born, but moreso just having a nostalgic vibe to them, so they dont necessarily have to be oldies.

We are getting close to the end of the year's new music, barring a few big releases in the first half of November (cough Rosalía cough).

I've been thinking about my top albums of the year and trying to make a short list of what I enjoyed the most, and I'm really curious to hear more ideas from other people.

So what album outside of the popular choices is your favorite of the year? What albums did people miss that deserve more love?
